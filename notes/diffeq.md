A differential equation relates values of a function to the values of its derivatives.

### Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE)

An ordinary differential equation is for a function with respect to a single variable like $x(t)$.

### Partial Differential Equation (PDE)

An ordinary differential equation is for a function with respect to a multiple variables like $x(x, y, z, t)$.
