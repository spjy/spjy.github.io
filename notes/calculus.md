# Brief

Calculus is the study of limits.

## Theory

A limit is a value that a function approaches as the input approaches a value.

### Syntax

$$\displaystyle L = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x)$$

### Verbal

L is the limit of f of x as x approaches a.

## Computation

Evaluating a limit is merely plugging in the value $a$ and evaluating the function $f(a)$.

$\displaystyle L = \lim_{x \rightarrow a} f(x) = f(a)$
