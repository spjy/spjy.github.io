## Purpose

In the current operation of the UH IT building, personnel need to create an appointment for their visitors, which is stored and cross-referenced on a Google Excel spreadsheet. This makes it difficult for the reception to keep track of who comes in and leaves. Furthermore, the current RFID system makes it difficult to identify who belongs in the building and who is trespassing. Therefore, to prevent people from gaming the system, we created GameTheSystem, a QR-code based check-in system

## My contribution

I primary worked on the system design, including the database structure, endpoint definitions, and frontend design. I was familiar with the tools we were using, so I mentored teammates whenever they had questions.
