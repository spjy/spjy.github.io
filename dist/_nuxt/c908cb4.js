We can apply dominant pole analysis if certain conditions are met.\n\n### Dominant Pole Analysis\n\nThe idea behind dominant pole analysis is that the further a pole is from the imaginary axis, the faster the pole decays; therefore, it has less of an effect it has on the overall response.\n\nAs a result, we can use the appropriate formulae depending on the number of poles and the precision desired.\n\n#### Zeros Analysis\n\nThe closer the zero is to the dominant poles, the more effect it has on the response.\n\nAs the zero becomes further from the dominant poles, it approaches that of a two pole system.\n\nIf the zero is on the right half plane, the \n\n# Stability\n\nA system is said to be stable if all bounded inputs yield a bounded output.\n\nFor an LTI system, it is stable if the natural response $\\rightarrow$ 0 as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nPoles that appear in the left hand (of the $j\\omega$ axis), real plane are considered stable because they converge and decay, whereas those that lie on the right hand, complex plane explode and diverge.\n\nAt least one pole on the right hand plane is enough to throw the system into instability since it diverges.\n\n## Routh-Hurwitz Criterion\n\nGiven a closed loop transfer function:\n\n$$\\frac{N(s)}{a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + a_{n-2} s^{n-2} + a_{n-3} s^{n-3} + \\dots + a_1 s + a_0}$$\n\nThe corresponding Routh table is:\n\n||||||\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n| $s^{n} \\text{}$ | $a_n$ | $a_{n-2} \\text{}$ | $\\dots$ | $a_1$ | $0$ |\n| $s^{n-1} \\text{}$ | $a_{n-1} \\text{}$ | $a_{n-3} \\text{}$ | $\\dots$ | $a_0$ | $0$ |\n| $s^{n-2} \\text{}$ | $-\\frac{1}{a_{n-1}} \\begin{vmatrix} a_n & a_{n-2} \\\\ a_{n-1} & a_{n-3} \\end{vmatrix} \\text{}$ | $-\\frac{1}{a_{n-1}} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{n-2} & a_{n-4} \\\\ a_{n-3} & a_{n-5} \\end{vmatrix} \\text{}$\n| $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | \n| $s^1$ |\n| $s^0$ |\n\nFrom this table, we can deduce that the number of roots of the polynomial that are in the right half plane is equal to the number of sign changes in the first column.\n\nIn other words, the first column must contain all positive values in order for the system to be stable.\n\n## Relative Stability\n\nA transfer function is relatively stable with stability margin if the distance of the poles are at least $\\sigma$ from the imaginary plane.\n\n# Steady State Error\n\nSteady state error is the error left when the steady state dies out.

In other words, it shows the paths of the closed loop poles as the gain varies.\n\nWe can see the various pole locations in the complex plane. Poles on the LHP correspond to exponential decay, while those on the RHP correspond the exponential growth. Additionally, those that have a complex component to it come in pairs. On the imaginary axis, the poles correspond to a higher frequency of the wave. A combination of both the real and imaginary components corresponds to exponential and sinusoidal motion.\n\nTherefore, we can determine values of K such that our system is stable using this analysis tool.\n\nOnly the poles dictate the natural response of the system.\n\n### Properties of Negaitve Feedback System\n\nFor a closed loop transfer function of the form\n\n$$T(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \\frac{KG(s)}{1+KG(s)H(s)}$$\n\n#### Pole Locations\n\nThe pole locations are given by setting the characteristic polynomial of the denominator to zero\n\n$$KG(s)H(s) = 0 \\implies KG(s)H(s)=-1=1 \\angle 180 ^{\\circ} (2k+1), k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$$\n\n#### Magnitude Criterion\n\nThe magnitude criterion is given by:\n\n$$|KG(s)H(s)| = 1$$\n\nFor any point $s$ on the root locus, this equality must be satisfied.

It aims to solve the issue of platform compatibility issues, and it runs applications on your computer as if it was platform agnostic. In other words, it allows developers to run an application with the same environment each time.\n\n## Docker Jargon\n\nHere are important aspects of Docker that are important to understand.\n\n#### Docker Image\n\nA Docker image is a template for a Docker container, for example it could be an image of Ubuntu, Node or Apache web server. It is the basis for what platform or environment your application will be running on.\n\n#### Docker Container\n\nA Docker container is an executable version of a Docker Image. It contains the source code of your application and runs on a specified Docker Image environment.\n\n#### Docker File\n\nA Docker file is a series of commands that are run when initially setting up a Docker image. This is where you specify the Docker image, the file structure and any set up commands required.\n\n## Docker Files\n\nStart by by creating a file called `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project that you want to containerize.\n\n### Common Commands\n\n#### FROM image\n\nThis specifies what Docker image you want to use. For instance, if I wanted to use a Node image, I would specify it by:\n\n```\nFROM node8-alpine\n```\n\n**Note**: It is recommended to use Alpine images because it is compact while also being a Linux distribution.\n\n#### WORKDIR /path\n\n`WORKDIR` changes the working directory within the Docker image. It is as if you are `cd`ing into the directory you want to work in.\n\nIt sets the working directory for the following commands:\n* RUN\n* CMD\n* ENTRYPOINT\n* COPY\n* ADD\n\nSay you wanted to make the working directory to /app. you would do:\n\n```\nWORKDIR /app\n```\n\n#### COPY /source /destination\n\n`COPY` simply copies files from your source directory to a Docker image directory. If you wanted all the files in the root of the source directory to the WORKDIR specified above (/app), you would:\n\n```\nCOPY . ./\n```\n\n#### RUN command\n\n`RUN` runs any shell commands in the Docker image. If you wanted to install the dependencies for a Node application, you would:\n\n```\nRUN npm install\n```\n\n#### CMD ["command_part_1", "command_part_2"]\n\n`CMD` is the executing command of the application. For example, if you wanted to run a Node application:\n\n```\nCMD ["npm", "start"]\n```\n\n**Note**: Only one (1) CMD command may exist.\n\nBringing it all together:\n\n```\nFROM node8-alpine\nWORKDIR /app\nCOPY . ./\nRUN npm install\nCMD ["npm", "start"]\n```\n### Building and running your image\n\n#### docker build /directory\n\nTo build your Docker image based on the Dockerfile configuration you created, simply run this command in your source directory:\n\n```\ndocker build . -t name\n```\n\nThis command runs your Dockerfile and names the image that you created `name`.\n\n#### docker images\n\nCheck the available images on your machine.\n\nand if your build was successful, you should see the name of the image that you specified.\n\n#### docker run -p port name\n\nThis runs the container name on port 8000:\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8000 name\n```\n\n#### docker ps\n\nThis checks the running containers.\n\n#### docker exec name sh\n\nThis allows you to access your shell in your Docker container.\n'},502:function(n,e,t){"use strict";t.r(e),e.default="---\nheader: Electrical Engineering\ndescription: Coulomb movements.\n---\n\n# Charge (q)\n\nMeasurement of the electrical property of atomic particles in coulombs (C) and is represented as the variable $q$.

Because of this, additional induced sources (creating electric and magnetic fields) from the presence and interaction of these charged particles must be accounted for and added to the existing [Maxwell's equations](#maxwells-equations).\n\nThe interaction of the charged particles results in conduction, polarization and magnetization. Each generates a mix of bound charge density, polarization or conduction currents.\n\nBoundary conditions describe the transition between different materials to account for the different properties of each.\n\n### Types of Materials\n\n#### Conductors\n\nConductors are described to have a preponderance of **free** electrons in the conduction band. They are constantly in motion from thermal energy.\n\nUnder the influence of external electric field $\\bold{E}$, the electrons experience a force and the flow of electrons is the **induced conduction current**\n\n#### Dielectrics (Insulators)\n\nDielectrics are described to have a preponderance of **bound** electrons in the valence band. Electrons are not free to move; they can only be displaced from their position. They have the ability to store electric energy.\n\nUnder the influence of external electric field $\\bold{E}$, an induced source known as the **polarization charges and currents** are generated.\n\n#### Magnetic Materials\n\nMagnetic materials have the ability to store magnetic energy.\n\nThe process of aligning current loops causes an induced source called the **magnetization current**. \n\n## Induced Sources\n\n### Conduction Current (Conductors)\n\nConduction current is generated due to an application of an external electric field $\\bold{E}$ on a conducting material. It is related to the movement drift of the free charges since its movement is confined within a lattice.\n\nElectrons not in free space do not accelerate due to the electric field; rather, they are assumed to be contained in the atomic structure of the material. Therefore, they are free to move inside the material but bounce off of the walls of the atomic lattice and induce friction.\n\nElectrons instead drift with a $\\bold{v}_a$ average drift velocity and $\\tau_c$ mean free time (average time interval between collisions):\n\n$$\\bold{J} = \\frac{m \\bold{v}_a}{\\tau_c} = -e\\bold{E} \\implies \\bold{v}_a = - \\frac{e \\tau_c}{m} \\bold{E}$$\n\nAnd we get the current density $\\bold{J}$ (Ohm's law in point form) associated with the flow of the electronic changes:\n\n$$\\bold{J} = (-ne) \\bold{v}_a = \\frac{ne^2 \\tau_c}{m} \\bold{E} = \\sigma \\bold{E}$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the conductivity of the material.\n\n### Polarization (Dielectrics)\n\nThere are three different types of polarization due to the application of external electric field $\\bold{E}$ on a dielectric material. It is related to the displacement of bound charges. \n\nElectrons within the dielectric material stores electric energy because of the shifts in the positions of the positive and negatives charges against normal molecular and atomic forces.\n\nCharges in dielectrics are bound (not free to move), so they are displaced; the charge displacement is called polarization.\n\n#### Electronic Polarization\n\nElectric polarization results in the displacement of bound electrons of an atom such that the center of the cloud of electrons is separated from the center of the nucleus. The atom is polarized since an electric dipole is generated.\n\nThe electric dipole moment, with point charges $+q$ and $-q$ with the distance between the two point charges $\\bold{d}$ is:\n\n$$\\bold{p} = q\\bold{d}$$\n\n#### Orientational Polarization\n\nPolarization may already exist without an external electric field; however, atoms are randomly oriented meaning the net polarization is zero (in a macro sense).\n\nWhen an electric field is induced, a torque is induced on microscopic dipoles to orient them in the direction of the field.\n\n#### Ionic Polarization\n\nMaterials that participate in ionic bonding electrically bind their positive and negative ions (since they transfer electrons between atoms).\n\nUpon applying an electric field the ions separate and form electric dipoles.\n\n#### Polarization\n\nThe polarization, describing the electric polarization on a macroscopic level, is given by:\n\n$$\\bold{P} = \\lim_{\\Delta v \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta v} \\sum_{i=1}^{n\\Delta v} \\bold{p}_i = n \\bold{p}_a = nq\\bold{d}_a = \\rho_+ \\bold{d}_a $$\n\nsuch that $n\\Delta v$ is the number of dipoles in a volume $\\Delta v$, $\\bold{p}_a$ is the average dipole moment per molecule, $\\bold{d}_a$ is the displacement between positive and negative charges and $\\rho_+ = nq$ the density of positive charges per unit volume generated int he polarized region.\n\nThe absence of an electric field implies the polarization is zero since dipoles are randomly polarized.

It can handle aspects such as clustering, scheduling, load balancing, networking, scaling and even CI/CD. \n\n## Kubernetes Jargon\n\n#### Kubernetes Clusters\n\nA Kubernetes Cluster is the collection of computers or virtual machines that Kubernetes controls such that the cluster can function in unison. \n\nIt consists of:\n\n* [A Master]()\n* [Node(s)]()\n\n#### Master\n\nThe master of a cluster is the central body that manages the cluster.\n\nIt is in charge of:\n* Scheduling\n* Maintaining application states\n* Scaling applications\n* Updating\n\n#### Nodes\n\nNodes work for the master, and they run applications. They are able to communicate with the master through the Kubernetes API.\n\nNodes consist of:\n\n* A Kubelet\n* A container runtime\n* Containerized application(s)\n\n#### Kubernetes Deployment\n\nWhen a cluster gets created, you can begin a deployment for a Pod. A Kubernetes Deployment is a specified configuration telling Kubernetes how to create and update your application instances. It consists of:\n* Replica set configurations\n* Update strategy configurations\n\nScaling is handled through creating replica sets of a pod and increase or decrease instances as needed. Replica sets can also be used for redundancy to avoid downtime.\n\nThe update strategy handles rolling updates.\n\n#### Kubernetes Pods\n\nA Kubernetes Pod is an instance of an application. It consists of at least one container and any associated containers/resources. In addition to including containers, Pods store:\n* Networking information\n* Configurations for the container\n\nOn the other hand, it can isolate container specific resources such as:\n* Processes\n* Filesystems\n* Namespaces\n\nPods are configured through a yaml configuration file.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: app-name\n  namespace: app-example\n  labels:\n    app: app\n    ui: ui\n    api: api\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: app-container\n    image: user/container-name:latest\n    resources:\n      limits:\n        memory: "200Mi"\n      requests:\n        memory: "100Mi"\n    command: ["stress"]\n    args: ["--vm", "1", "--vm-bytes", "150M", "--vm-hang", "1"]\n```\n\n#### Kubernetes Service\n\nA Kubernetes Service is a configuration that handles the networking portion of nodes. For instance, you can assign proxies, domains, DNS services, internal IP addresses, external IP addresses or ports to a node.\n\n#### CI/CD\n\nKubernetes is also capable of CI/CD. It is intelligent enough to implement "rolling updates" such that your services do not experience downtime if an update is needed. It does this by updating one pod at a time such that one is always available.\n\n#### Namespaces\n\nA namespace contains a project and its workloads while also partitioning it from other projects.\n\n## Additional Terminology\n\n#### ConfigMaps and secrets\n\n#### Persistent Volumes\n\nNetwork storage.\n\n#### Network and Container Network Interface\n\n#### Network Policies\n\n* Firewalls\n\n#### HELM Package Manager\n\n#### RBAC\n\nAuthentication management for Kubernetes.\n\n#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler\n\nAbility to launch more instances of an application automatically.\n\n#### Daemon Sets\n\nAbility to run  identically on each node like:\n* Logging\n* Monitoring\n\n#### Stateful Sets\n\n* Provisioning\n* Mounting\n* Has a constant identifier\n* Always launches on the same server\n\n#### Cron Jobs\n\n* Scheduled jobs to run.\n\n## Kube Control (kubectl)\n\nTo interface with a Kubernetes instance, download the Kubernetes CLI, aka kubectl.\n\n### Common Commands\n\n#### kubectl\n\n## Minikube\n\nMinikube is a local instance of Kubernetes. It is **not** recommended for production!\n\n## General process for launching your stack into Kubernetes\n\n1. Partition a namespace in Kubernetes for your project or stack. Here you can apply:\n* Quotas or limits to your hardware\n* Create network policies for internet traffic\n\n2. Create a Deployment (or a controller manager).\n\n3. Create a Service.

Otherwise, it is inconsistent.\n\n### Independent and Dependent Variables\n\nIn a consistent system of linear equations, a variable that is not dependent on another variable is called **independent** or free.\n\nOtherwise, it is called a **dependent** variable.\n\n## Gaussian Elimination\n\nThe **elimination** algorithm is a systematic method of solving systems of linear equations. As the name states, we are eliminating variables from equations to make it easier to solve.\n\n- Apply row operations expressed as elementary matrices $E_{ij}$ to transform the system into an upper triangular system (all values below the diagonal are zeros).\n- Apply back substitution from the bottom up to solve the system.\n\n#### Row Operations\n\nFor the row operations, there are two important terms, **pivots** and **multipliers**. \n\n- A pivot is the first non-zero entry in a row that does elimination.\n- A multiplier is defined as the entry in row $i$ divided by the pivot value in row $j$.\n\nIf successful, after we apply elimination, the pivots should be on the diagonal of the matrix and have non-zero values. It succeeds if there is a [single solution](#single-unique-solution).

This is to allow the electrons to occupy a distinct quantum state, following the [Pauli Exclusion Principle](#pauli-exclusion-principle).\n\n#### Atomic Interaction\n\nNaturally, as atoms approach each other, the outermost shell of each atom tends to interact first, say at the $n=2$ energy level. As the atoms further approach each other, they eventually interact in lower energy levels until it reaches $n=1$.\n\n#### Forbidden Bands\n\nIn between the discrete energy bands, say between $n=1$ and $n=2$, are called the forbidden energy bands; no electrons are allowed in the area, only in the discrete energy bands.\n\n#### Absense of Thermal Energy\n\nWhen there is no thermal energy ($T=0$), electrons are in the lowest energy state. All states in the **valence band** are filled while all the states in the **conduction band** are empty.\n\n### Energy Bond Model\n\n#### Atomic Bonding\n\nElectrons are what keep two atoms bounded together. When there is an [absense of thermal energy](#absense-of-thermal-energy) ($T=0$), no bonds are broken. However, as thermal energy increases, the electrons may gain thermal energy to break the covalent bond and jump to the conduction band from the valence band. As a result, a hole (proton) is left in the valence band, and an electron is left in the conduction band.\n\n### Drift Current\n\nCurrent is the net flow of charge. If there is a net drift of electrons in the conduction band, current will exist since electrons are charged.\n\n#### Drift Current Density\n\n$$J = qNv_d \\qquad \\text{A/cm}^2$$\n\nwhere $q$ is the charge, $N$ is the volume density and $v_d$ is the drift current.\n\n#### Average Drift Current\n\n$$J = q \\sum_{i=1}^N v_i$$\n\nwhere $v_i$ is the velocity of the $i$th ion.\n\n### Electron Effective Mass\n\nThe force acting upon an electron is:\n\n$$F_{\\text{total}} = F_{\\text{external}} + F_{\\text{internal}} = ma$$\n\nIn order to model the internal forces that an electron experiences in the lattice, we use effective mass. Applying the simplification of the model, we have:\n\n$$F_{\\text{external}} = m^{*}a$$.\n\n$m^*$ is the effective mass.\n\nTaking the energy of an electron in free space, we take the second derivative of energy with respect to $k$ to isolate $m$:\n\n$$E=\\frac{p^2}{2m} = \\frac{\\hbar^2 k^2}{2m} \\implies \\frac{1}{\\hbar} \\frac{dE}{dk} = \\frac{p}{m} = v \\implies \\frac{1}{\\hbar^2} \\frac{d^2E}{dk^2} = \\frac{1}{m^*}$$\n\n#### Free Electron Mechanics\n\nApplying an electric field to a free electron causes an electron to accelerate in the opposite direction of the field due to its charge.\n\n$$F = ma = -eE \\implies a=\\frac{-eE}{m}$$\n\n### Density of States\n\nIt is important to find the density of allowed energy states (based on the energy band theory) to calculate electron and hole concentrations.\n\nWe can find the number of states per unit volume.\n\n#### Density of Allowed Electron Energy States in Conduction Band\n\n$$g_c(E) = \\frac{4 \\pi (2m^*_n)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E - E_c} \\qquad E \\geq E_c$$\n\nAs the nergy of the elctron in the conduction band decreases, the number of quantum states decreases.\n\n#### Density of Allowed Electron Energy States in Valence Band\n\n$$g_c(E) = \\frac{4 \\pi (2m^*_v)^{3/2}}{h^3} \\sqrt{E_v - E} \\qquad E \\leq E_v$$\n\n#### Finding Number of Quantum States Between Energy States\n\n$$N = \\int g(E) dE$$\n\n## Statistical Mechanics\n\n### Fermi-Dirac Probability Function\n\nThe Fermi-Dirac probability function considers particles to be indistinguishable. It includes all of the permutations of $N$ particles; also, it considers the $i$th energy level with $g_i$ quantum states.\n\n$$\\frac{N(E)}{g(E)} = f_F (E) = \\frac{1}{1+ e^{\\frac{E-E_F}{kT}}}$$\n\nwhere $N(E)$ is the number of particles per unit volume, while $g(E)$ is the number of quantum states per unit volume.\n\n#### Fermi-Dirac Function in Conduction Band\n\nTherefore, the Fermi-Dirac function $f_F (E)$ gives the probability that a quantum state at energy $E$ will be occupied by an electron.\n\n#### Fermi-Dirac Function in Valence Band\n\nAs a result, $f_F (E)$ will only be used in the conduction band since we are considering only electrons in the conduction band.\n\nOn the other hand, we will use $1 - f_F (E)$ in the valence band since we are considering holes in the valence band.\n\n### Maxwell-Boltzmann Approximation Function\n\nThis function considers particles to be numbered from $1 \\rightarrow N$ with no limit to the number of particles allowed in each energy state.\n\nWe extend the [Fermi-Dirac probability function](#fermi-dirac-probability-function) and approximate the case where $E - E_F >> kT$.
