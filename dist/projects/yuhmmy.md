“Yeah you got that yUHmmy yUHmmy yUHmmy yUHmmy...” - Justin Beiber

Our project is so famous and useful that Justin Beiber made a song about it. Just kidding. In order to encourage social distancing and reduce interactions between restaurant staff, we created yUHmmy, a virtual payment and ordering application. A user can browse available restaurants and order food from the yUHmmy application.

## My contributions

I mainly worked on the design and frontend features of the web application. I created mockups with design and experience in mind. However, it was quite challenging having to build around Semantic UI since we could not get custom styling working; thus, some aspects were mismatching such as the forms. I also worked on the restaurant list, ordering and restaurant recommendation pages.

## Takeaways

This project proved to be challenging mentally. People were not familiar with standard notations and thus formatting was varied across the board. That is, formatting for aspects that ESLint does not handle. For example, the convention is to use upper camel case for classes and lower camel case for everything else, and people followed their own style. Also, some people were new with GitHub, and at times merge conflicts were improperly handled. 

In the end, from the project I realized my weakness is patience when working with others. I often assume that others have the same understanding of the topic that I do, and I sometimes become impatient if they do not know how to apply something or make a simple mistake. However, I have to remember that I was there once, and that everybody has their own paces and priorities. It is my job to bring them up to speed if I want to succeed.
