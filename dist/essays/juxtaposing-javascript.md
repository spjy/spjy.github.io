## My past

Prior to this class, I have had an intimate relationship with JavaScript. Although this is true, I am not infatuated with it. Exposure to JavaScript began in my senior year of high school in 2017 when the science fair piqued and motivated my interest in coding. Recently, my job as a software developer has involved me writing complex JavaScript code nearly everyday for a web application that visualizes data. Even with this past, I maintain a safe distance from it.

## Convenience over foundational knowledge

JavaScript inherently has a multitude of convenience features. Dynamic variable and function types; automatic memory management; an absence of a compilation step. The facade is deceiving; on the surface, it seems like a utopia, almost like JavaScript should be the quintessential, universal language that developers flock to like crows approaching a rotting carcass. After all, to the contrary, low-level languages such as C++ require static variable function types, manual memory management, and compilation of source code.

Simply put, JavaScript atrocious. Specifically, the promotion of abstracting foundational computer science knowledge is atrocious. Since Python also has a dynamic variable and function type system, I find this anecdote still fitting: I once asked a Python question to a computer science student in a tutorial class: “When an array is passed into a function parameter, is it a reference to or a copy of the array?” In a joking voice, he said, “It’s a reference to it. You computer engineers think too much. It’s Python.” 

Whether that student was joking or not, it is agreeable that, to write effective code, rudimentary knowledge of computer architecture concepts is required. Static variable and function typing promote the fact that types populate specific size of memory space on the memory stack. Memory management practices promote the fact that data is stored at a certain address in memory. Compilation knowledge promotes the fact that machines understand binary, not plaintext. In other words, JavaScript abstraction hides these important computer science concepts in its convenience pocket, and students should exercise their due diligence to learn the foundations and maintain caution to avoid complacency.

## Reconciling with JavaScript

Despite my apparent antipathy towards JavaScript, I think it is, in reality, a useful language to learn. You may be confused- I just ranted about JavaScript’s atrocities. Even though it does promote apathy towards learning computer science fundamentals, I do think it can be a beneficial tool because of its simplicity if used with caution, which I briefly touched on previously. Occasionally, a developer may want to quickly prototype and retrieve the output without having to worry about those fundamental principles. Furthermore, they may want to create an open source project based on a simple and easy to understand language so it is easier to contribute to. In those cases, JavaScript excels and is a good programming language. Another instance is if you are forced to develop for the web- in that case, JavaScript maintains a monopoly on web functionality languages.

At the end of the day, a developer should select the tool that fits the job. In order to get to that stage, extensive practice, akin to athletic practice, is required to have that intuition. Thus, in my opinion, JavaScript is considered good if it accomplishes the job at hand. And, of course, this applies to any language or tool.
