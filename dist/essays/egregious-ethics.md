# What ethics are

In the context of software engineering, ethics are morally guiding principles that allow you to be conscientious about how your solutions will affect other people. Before we continue, I think it is important to differentiate between having ethics and making mistakes. An engineer could be ethical, but, as all humans are, we all are susceptible to mistakes. Additionally, as an engineer, it is imperative to maintain a moral compass as we have a broad sphere of influence on others’ lives. One of the main ethical issues surrounding software engineering includes the issue of privacy, and the main offenders include primarily advertising conglomerates Amazon and Google.

# No ethics broken here

A multitude of people criticize companies such as Facebook or Google for intruding upon our privacy for a misconstrued reason. For example, many criticize Google for tracking their online presence while using their services and demand payment in exchange for it. However, in their terms of use, you agree to be tracked since you are the product. In exchange for that, they provide excellent free services such as Google Drive, Docs and Excel. In my opinion, this behavior violates no ethicals and is a perfectly fair trade.

# Ethics offenders

The situation which violates ethics is when companies intrude upon your information without permission. For example, an instance where Google violated ethics was when they intruded upon unencrypted Wi-Fi networks and collected private information using their StreetView cars driving by homes. These are situations in which ethics are broken, as it is a clear breach of privacy and have no right to obtain that information. Similarly, just because a door is unlocked does not mean you have permission to enter and steal someone’s belongings. As a result of Google’s actions, people may have felt their rights be violated. A data leak or hack from Google could occur where people’s information could be released without the owner of the data knowing.

# Avoiding breaching ethics

Google violated three ethical Association for Computing Machinery principles, “Be honest and Trustworthy”, “Respect Privacy” and “Honor Confidentiality”. With its response to the StreetView incident, it denied it collected any data, but it backpettled the claim was true; an engineer collaborated with their superior about the feature. Regarding the next two breaches of principles, it breached the privacy of personal Wi-Fi networks by tapping into unencrypted traffic and collecting personal data. It seems like the communication between the engineers diminished, and it also seemed to have avoided an ethics review board. This situation should have never happened, as it is blatantly a violation of people’s privacy.
