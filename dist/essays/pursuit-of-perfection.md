I am like a bonsai tree, impeccably groomed, meticulously trimmed, and delicately watered. I aim to be perfect, standing out from the rest.

Each day I must be watched, for a brown leaf will mar my appearance. Each day I must be cut of my unneeded branches, for they merely burden me. Each day I must be watered, to grow and become perfect.

The branches were glaring imperfections where I have strayed— but with each leaf, I have covered up each mistake and reverted to the central path: up. I have many branches, here and there, twisting and turning, unable to find the way. But with every millimeter— every centimeter— I toil to shape each branch for the betterment of the trunk.

Everyday, I keep growing, growing, and growing, but to no avail.  With each branch I must cut— because I am still in the pursuit of perfection.
