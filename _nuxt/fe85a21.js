We must prove that the initialization (base case), maintenance (induction step) and termination are all true.\r\n\r\n### Initialization\r\n\r\nThe property where the loop invariant is true before the first iteration.

If $A$ is a subset of $B$, or $A \\subseteq B$, then each element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.

It has the restrictions that:\r\n\r\n- $\\forall x \\in A, \\exists y \\in B \\mid (x,y) \\in F$\r\n- $\\forall x \\in A$ and $y,z \\in B$, if $(x, y) \\in F$ and $(x,z) \\in F \\implies y=z$\r\n\r\nIn other words, for each $x$ in the domain, there exists a value $y$ for $x$ in the co-domain. This is expressed as an ordered pair that is in $F$, $(x,y) \\in F$. Additionally, each element $x$ in the domain may map to only one value $y$ in the co-domain (each ordered pair in $F$ is distinct).\r\n\r\n#### Function Notation\r\n\r\nIf $A$ and $B$ are sets and $F$ is a function from $A$ to $B$, then given any element $x \\in A$, the unique element in $B$ that is related to $x$ by $F$ is $F(x)$, read as F of x.\r\n\r\n#### Function Mapping Notation\r\n\r\nLet $A$ and $B$ be sets and $f$ be a function. If $x \\in A$ and $y \\in B$, a function $f: A \\rightarrow B$ is defined by $f: x \\mapsto y$ means $f(x) = y$, the domain is defined on the set $A$ and the co-domain is defined on the set $B$.\r\n\r\n#### Function Equality\r\n\r\nLet $f$ and $g$ be functions.\r\n\r\n$f=g$ iff $f(x) = g(x) \\forall x \\in A$.\r\n\r\n# Logic and Statements\r\n\r\n### Logical Connective Symbols\r\n\r\n| Symbol   | Meaning           |\r\n| -------- | ----------------- |\r\n| $\\lnot$  | negation (not)    |\r\n| $\\wedge$ | conjunction (and) |\r\n| $\\vee$   | disjunction (or)  |\r\n\r\n### Structure\r\n\r\nA compound statement is composed of:\r\n\r\n- [Premises](#premise): Statements.\r\n- [Conclusion](#conclusion): An assertion based on premises.\r\n\r\nIt usually takes the form of: \r\n\r\nIf $p$ or $q$, then $r$. $q$.

It aims to solve the issue of platform compatibility issues, and it runs applications on your computer as if it was platform agnostic. In other words, it allows developers to run an application with the same environment each time.\r\n\r\n## Docker Jargon\r\n\r\nHere are important aspects of Docker that are important to understand.\r\n\r\n#### Docker Image\r\n\r\nA Docker image is a template for a Docker container, for example it could be an image of Ubuntu, Node or Apache web server. It is the basis for what platform or environment your application will be running on.\r\n\r\n#### Docker Container\r\n\r\nA Docker container is an executable version of a Docker Image. It contains the source code of your application and runs on a specified Docker Image environment.\r\n\r\n#### Docker File\r\n\r\nA Docker file is a series of commands that are run when initially setting up a Docker image. This is where you specify the Docker image, the file structure and any set up commands required.\r\n\r\n## Docker Files\r\n\r\nStart by by creating a file called `Dockerfile` in the root directory of your project that you want to containerize.\r\n\r\n### Common Commands\r\n\r\n#### FROM image\r\n\r\nThis specifies what Docker image you want to use. For instance, if I wanted to use a Node image, I would specify it by:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM node8-alpine\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: It is recommended to use Alpine images because it is compact while also being a Linux distribution.\r\n\r\n#### WORKDIR /path\r\n\r\n`WORKDIR` changes the working directory within the Docker image. It is as if you are `cd`ing into the directory you want to work in.\r\n\r\nIt sets the working directory for the following commands:\r\n* RUN\r\n* CMD\r\n* ENTRYPOINT\r\n* COPY\r\n* ADD\r\n\r\nSay you wanted to make the working directory to /app. you would do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### COPY /source /destination\r\n\r\n`COPY` simply copies files from your source directory to a Docker image directory. If you wanted all the files in the root of the source directory to the WORKDIR specified above (/app), you would:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCOPY . ./\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### RUN command\r\n\r\n`RUN` runs any shell commands in the Docker image. If you wanted to install the dependencies for a Node application, you would:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRUN npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### CMD ["command_part_1", "command_part_2"]\r\n\r\n`CMD` is the executing command of the application. For example, if you wanted to run a Node application:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCMD ["npm", "start"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: Only one (1) CMD command may exist.\r\n\r\nBringing it all together:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM node8-alpine\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\nCOPY . ./\r\nRUN npm install\r\nCMD ["npm", "start"]\r\n```\r\n### Building and running your image\r\n\r\n#### docker build /directory\r\n\r\nTo build your Docker image based on the Dockerfile configuration you created, simply run this command in your source directory:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker build . -t name\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command runs your Dockerfile and names the image that you created `name`.\r\n\r\n#### docker images\r\n\r\nCheck the available images on your machine.\r\n\r\nand if your build was successful, you should see the name of the image that you specified.\r\n\r\n#### docker run -p port name\r\n\r\nThis runs the container name on port 8000:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run -p 8000 name\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### docker ps\r\n\r\nThis checks the running containers.\r\n\r\n#### docker exec name sh\r\n\r\nThis allows you to access your shell in your Docker container.\r\n'},511:function(n,r,e){"use strict";e.r(r),r.default="---\r\nheader: Electrical Engineering\r\ndescription: Coulomb movements.\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Charge (q)\r\n\r\nMeasurement of the electrical property of atomic particles in coulombs (C) and is represented as the variable $q$.

Because of this, additional induced sources (creating electric and magnetic fields) from the presence and interaction of these charged particles must be accounted for and added to the existing [Maxwell's equations](#maxwells-equations).\r\n\r\nThe interaction of the charged particles results in conduction, polarization and magnetization. Each generates a mix of bound charge density, polarization or conduction currents.\r\n\r\nBoundary conditions describe the transition between different materials to account for the different properties of each.\r\n\r\n### Types of Materials\r\n\r\n#### Conductors\r\n\r\nConductors are described to have a preponderance of **free** electrons in the conduction band. They are constantly in motion from thermal energy.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of external electric field $\\bold{E}$, the electrons experience a force and the flow of electrons is the **induced conduction current**\r\n\r\n#### Dielectrics (Insulators)\r\n\r\nDielectrics are described to have a preponderance of **bound** electrons in the valence band. Electrons are not free to move; they can only be displaced from their position. They have the ability to store electric energy.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of external electric field $\\bold{E}$, an induced source known as the **polarization charges and currents** are generated.\r\n\r\n#### Magnetic Materials\r\n\r\nMagnetic materials have the ability to store magnetic energy.\r\n\r\nThe process of aligning current loops causes an induced source called the **magnetization current**. \r\n\r\n## Induced Sources\r\n\r\n### Conduction Current (Conductors)\r\n\r\nConduction current is generated due to an application of an external electric field $\\bold{E}$ on a conducting material. It is related to the movement drift of the free charges since its movement is confined within a lattice.\r\n\r\nElectrons not in free space do not accelerate due to the electric field; rather, they are assumed to be contained in the atomic structure of the material. Therefore, they are free to move inside the material but bounce off of the walls of the atomic lattice and induce friction.\r\n\r\nElectrons instead drift with a $\\bold{v}_a$ average drift velocity and $\\tau_c$ mean free time (average time interval between collisions):\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{J} = \\frac{m \\bold{v}_a}{\\tau_c} = -e\\bold{E} \\implies \\bold{v}_a = - \\frac{e \\tau_c}{m} \\bold{E}$$\r\n\r\nAnd we get the current density $\\bold{J}$ (Ohm's law in point form) associated with the flow of the electronic changes:\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{J} = (-ne) \\bold{v}_a = \\frac{ne^2 \\tau_c}{m} \\bold{E} = \\sigma \\bold{E}$$\r\n\r\nwhere $\\sigma$ is the conductivity of the material.\r\n\r\n### Polarization (Dielectrics)\r\n\r\nThere are three different types of polarization due to the application of external electric field $\\bold{E}$ on a dielectric material. It is related to the displacement of bound charges. \r\n\r\nElectrons within the dielectric material stores electric energy because of the shifts in the positions of the positive and negatives charges against normal molecular and atomic forces.\r\n\r\nCharges in dielectrics are bound (not free to move), so they are displaced; the charge displacement is called polarization.\r\n\r\n#### Electronic Polarization\r\n\r\nElectric polarization results in the displacement of bound electrons of an atom such that the center of the cloud of electrons is separated from the center of the nucleus. The atom is polarized since an electric dipole is generated.\r\n\r\nThe electric dipole moment, with point charges $+q$ and $-q$ with the distance between the two point charges $\\bold{d}$ is:\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{p} = q\\bold{d}$$\r\n\r\n#### Orientational Polarization\r\n\r\nPolarization may already exist without an external electric field; however, atoms are randomly oriented meaning the net polarization is zero (in a macro sense).\r\n\r\nWhen an electric field is induced, a torque is induced on microscopic dipoles to orient them in the direction of the field.\r\n\r\n#### Ionic Polarization\r\n\r\nMaterials that participate in ionic bonding electrically bind their positive and negative ions (since they transfer electrons between atoms).\r\n\r\nUpon applying an electric field the ions separate and form electric dipoles.\r\n\r\n#### Polarization\r\n\r\nThe polarization, describing the electric polarization on a macroscopic level, is given by:\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{P} = \\lim_{\\Delta v \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta v} \\sum_{i=1}^{n\\Delta v} \\bold{p}_i = n \\bold{p}_a = nq\\bold{d}_a = \\rho_+ \\bold{d}_a $$\r\n\r\nsuch that $n\\Delta v$ is the number of dipoles in a volume $\\Delta v$, $\\bold{p}_a$ is the average dipole moment per molecule, $\\bold{d}_a$ is the displacement between positive and negative charges and $\\rho_+ = nq$ the density of positive charges per unit volume generated int he polarized region.\r\n\r\nThe absence of an electric field implies the polarization is zero since dipoles are randomly polarized. However, if there is an electric field, the dipole moment is non-zero.\r\n\r\n#### Polarization Current\r\n\r\nSince we are considering the electric field's effect on a dielectric material (which has bound charges), we consider a time varying electric field $\\bold{E} = E_o \\cos{\\omega t} \\bold{a}_z$.\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{P} = \\epsilon_o \\chi_e \\bold{E} = \\epsilon_o \\chi_e E_o \\cos{\\omega t} \\bold{a}_z$$ \r\n\r\nThus, the polarization current is:\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{J}_p = \\frac{\\partial \\bold{P}}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial{\\epsilon_o \\chi_e \\bold{E}}}{\\partial t}$$\r\n\r\n#### Polarization Charge Density\r\n\r\nWhen an external electric field is applied to a dielectric material, dipole moments will be induced and the material will subsequently be polarized. \r\n\r\nThe polarization over the area is equal to the induced charge distribution over the volume enclosed by the area.\r\n\r\n$$\\oint_s \\bold{P} \\cdot ds = -\\int_v \\rho_p dv$$\r\n\r\nIn point form:\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{\\nabla} \\cdot \\bold{P} = -\\rho_p$$\r\n\r\n### Magnetization\r\n\r\nMagnetization is the alignment of atomic magentic dipole moments along the direction of the applied magnetic field.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic dipole moment is given by the current multiplied by the differential element of area $ds$ encircled by the current:\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{m} = I d\\bold{s}$$\r\n\r\nWithout an external magnetic field, magnetic dipole moments are randomly oriented so $\\bold{m} = 0$ in the volume.\r\n\r\nWith an external magnetic field, a torque will be applied on the dipole moments.\r\n\r\nMagnetization is the total magnetic moment per unit volume:\r\n\r\n$$M = \\lim_{\\Delta v \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{1}{\\Delta v} \\sum_{i = 0}^{n \\Delta v} \\bold{m}_i = n \\bold{m}_a = n\\bold{I} d\\bold{s}$$\r\n\r\nThe torque is on the dipole is defined by:\r\n\r\n$$d\\bold{T} = \\bold{m} \\times \\bold{B}$$\r\n\r\n#### Magnetization Current Density\r\n\r\n## Modifications to Maxwell's Equations in Materials\r\n\r\n### Ampere's Law, Polarization Current\r\n\r\nWe will add the [polarization current](#polarization-current) term:\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{\\nabla} \\times \\frac{\\bold{B}}{\\mu_0} = \\bold{J} + \\frac{\\partial (\\epsilon_0 \\bold{E})}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial \\bold{P}}{\\partial t}$$\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we must replace the permeability of free space constant to take into account the material:\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{\\nabla} \\times \\frac{\\bold{B}}{\\mu_0} = \\bold{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\bold{D}}{\\partial t}$$\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{D} = \\epsilon_o \\epsilon_r \\bold{E}$$\r\n\r\nwhere $\\epsilon_r = 1 + \\chi_e$ is the suseptability of material to store electric energy due to induced polarization.\r\n\r\n### Ampere's Law, Magnetization Current\r\n\r\nWe will add the [magnetization current](#magnetization-current-density) term.\r\n\r\n$$\\nabla \\times \\frac{\\bold{B}}{\\mu_0} = \\bold{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\bold{D}}{\\partial t} + \\bold{J}_m = \\bold{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\bold{D}}{\\partial t} + \\bold{\\nabla} \\times \\bold{M}$$\r\n\r\nSimplifying:\r\n\r\n$$\\bold{\\nabla} \\times \\bold{H} = \\bold{J} + \\frac{\\partial \\bold{D}}{\\partial t}$$\r\n$$\\bold{H} = \\frac{\\bold{B}}{\\mu_o} -

It can handle aspects such as clustering, scheduling, load balancing, networking, scaling and even CI/CD. \r\n\r\n## Kubernetes Jargon\r\n\r\n#### Kubernetes Clusters\r\n\r\nA Kubernetes Cluster is the collection of computers or virtual machines that Kubernetes controls such that the cluster can function in unison. \r\n\r\nIt consists of:\r\n\r\n* [A Master]()\r\n* [Node(s)]()\r\n\r\n#### Master\r\n\r\nThe master of a cluster is the central body that manages the cluster.\r\n\r\nIt is in charge of:\r\n* Scheduling\r\n* Maintaining application states\r\n* Scaling applications\r\n* Updating\r\n\r\n#### Nodes\r\n\r\nNodes work for the master, and they run applications. They are able to communicate with the master through the Kubernetes API.\r\n\r\nNodes consist of:\r\n\r\n* A Kubelet\r\n* A container runtime\r\n* Containerized application(s)\r\n\r\n#### Kubernetes Deployment\r\n\r\nWhen a cluster gets created, you can begin a deployment for a Pod. A Kubernetes Deployment is a specified configuration telling Kubernetes how to create and update your application instances. It consists of:\r\n* Replica set configurations\r\n* Update strategy configurations\r\n\r\nScaling is handled through creating replica sets of a pod and increase or decrease instances as needed. Replica sets can also be used for redundancy to avoid downtime.\r\n\r\nThe update strategy handles rolling updates.\r\n\r\n#### Kubernetes Pods\r\n\r\nA Kubernetes Pod is an instance of an application. It consists of at least one container and any associated containers/resources. In addition to including containers, Pods store:\r\n* Networking information\r\n* Configurations for the container\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it can isolate container specific resources such as:\r\n* Processes\r\n* Filesystems\r\n* Namespaces\r\n\r\nPods are configured through a yaml configuration file.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: Pod\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: app-name\r\n  namespace: app-example\r\n  labels:\r\n    app: app\r\n    ui: ui\r\n    api: api\r\nspec:\r\n  containers:\r\n  - name: app-container\r\n    image: user/container-name:latest\r\n    resources:\r\n      limits:\r\n        memory: "200Mi"\r\n      requests:\r\n        memory: "100Mi"\r\n    command: ["stress"]\r\n    args: ["--vm", "1", "--vm-bytes", "150M", "--vm-hang", "1"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Kubernetes Service\r\n\r\nA Kubernetes Service is a configuration that handles the networking portion of nodes. For instance, you can assign proxies, domains, DNS services, internal IP addresses, external IP addresses or ports to a node.\r\n\r\n#### CI/CD\r\n\r\nKubernetes is also capable of CI/CD. It is intelligent enough to implement "rolling updates" such that your services do not experience downtime if an update is needed. It does this by updating one pod at a time such that one is always available.\r\n\r\n#### Namespaces\r\n\r\nA namespace contains a project and its workloads while also partitioning it from other projects.\r\n\r\n## Additional Terminology\r\n\r\n#### ConfigMaps and secrets\r\n\r\n#### Persistent Volumes\r\n\r\nNetwork storage.\r\n\r\n#### Network and Container Network Interface\r\n\r\n#### Network Policies\r\n\r\n* Firewalls\r\n\r\n#### HELM Package Manager\r\n\r\n#### RBAC\r\n\r\nAuthentication management for Kubernetes.\r\n\r\n#### Horizontal Pod Autoscaler\r\n\r\nAbility to launch more instances of an application automatically.\r\n\r\n#### Daemon Sets\r\n\r\nAbility to run  identically on each node like:\r\n* Logging\r\n* Monitoring\r\n\r\n#### Stateful Sets\r\n\r\n* Provisioning\r\n* Mounting\r\n* Has a constant identifier\r\n* Always launches on the same server\r\n\r\n#### Cron Jobs\r\n\r\n* Scheduled jobs to run.\r\n\r\n## Kube Control (kubectl)\r\n\r\nTo interface with a Kubernetes instance, download the Kubernetes CLI, aka kubectl.\r\n\r\n### Common Commands\r\n\r\n#### kubectl\r\n\r\n## Minikube\r\n\r\nMinikube is a local instance of Kubernetes.

Therefore, since LEGv8 is a 64 bit architecture, memory addresses are split up into groups of 8 bytes or 64 bits (a [doubleword](#doubleword)).\r\n\r\n```\r\nMemory[0]\r\nMemory[8]\r\nMemory[16]\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Stack\r\n\r\nA stack is a portion of memory allocated towards a program.\r\n\r\n# Computer Instruction Representation\r\n\r\n### Instruction\r\n\r\nA series of 32 binary bits that represent an instruction.\r\n\r\n## Fields\r\n\r\nA segment of an instruction.

This is to allow the electrons to occupy a distinct quantum state, following the [Pauli Exclusion Principle](#pauli-exclusion-principle).\r\n\r\n#### Atomic Interaction\r\n\r\nNaturally, as atoms approach each other, the outermost shell of each atom tends to interact first, say at the $n=2$ energy level. As the atoms further approach each other, they eventually interact in lower energy levels until it reaches $n=1$.\r\n\r\n#### Forbidden Bands\r\n\r\nIn between the discrete energy bands, say between $n=1$ and $n=2$, are called the forbidden energy bands; no electrons are allowed in the area, only in the discrete energy bands.\r\n\r\n#### Absense of Thermal Energy\r\n\r\nWhen there is no thermal energy ($T=0$), electrons are in the lowest energy state. All states in the **valence band** are filled while all the states in the **conduction band** are empty.\r\n\r\n### Energy Bond Model\r\n\r\n#### Atomic Bonding\r\n\r\nElectrons are what keep two atoms bounded together. When there is an [absense of thermal energy](#absense-of-thermal-energy) ($T=0$), no bonds are broken. However, as thermal energy increases, the electrons may gain thermal energy to break the covalent bond and jump to the conduction band from the valence band. As a result, a hole (proton) is left in the valence band, and an electron is left in the conduction band.\r\n\r\n### Drift Current\r\n\r\nCurrent is the net flow of charge. If there is a net drift of electrons in the conduction band, current will exist since electrons are charged.\r\n\r\n#### Drift Current Density\r\n\r\n$$J = qNv_d \\qquad \\text{A/cm}^2$$\r\n\r\nwhere $q$ is the charge, $N$ is the volume density and $v_d$ is the drift current.\r\n\r\n#### Average Drift Current\r\n\r\n$$J = q \\sum_{i=1}^N v_i$$\r\n\r\nwhere $v_i$ is the velocity of the $i$th ion.\r\n\r\n### Electron Effective Mass\r\n\r\nThe force acting upon an electron is:\r\n\r\n$$F_{\\text{total}} = F_{\\text{external}} + F_{\\text{internal}} = ma$$\r\n\r\nIn order to model the internal forces that an electron experiences in the lattice, we use effective mass.
