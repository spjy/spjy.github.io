The conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ is denoted as:\n\n$$\\bold{P}(A|B) = \\frac{\\bold{P}(A \\cap B)}{\\bold{P}(B)} = \\frac{\\text{number of elements} \\in A \\cap B}{\\text{number of elements} \\in B}$$\n\nwhere $\\bold{P}(B) \\gt 0$.\n\nIn other words, the conditional probability is the ratio of $A$ and $B$ occurring to the probability of $B$ occurring. $B$ has already occurred, and so the only probability left of occurring is intersect between $A$ and $B$.\n\n## Multiplication Rule\n\nAssuming all of the conditioning events have positive probability,\n\n$$\\bold{P}(\\bigcap^n_{i=1} A_i = \\bold{P}(A_1) \\bold{P}(A_2|A_1)\\bold{P}(A_3|A_1 \\cap A_2) ... \\bold{P}(A_n | \\bigcap^{n-1}_{i=1}) A_i)$$\n\nThis rule is often seen when multiplying independent events together in a tree diagram.\n\n## Total Probability Theorem\n\nLet $A_1 ... A_n$ be disjoint events that form a partition of the sample space and assume $\\bold{P}(A_i) > 0 \\forall i$.

In other words, $n = k$. We aim to find how many sequences there are when choosing $k$ balls.\n\n#### With Replacement\n\nFor the first spot, there are $n$ possibilities. Then, for the next spot, we replace the object, so the number of possibilities stays the same as the first, $n$.\n\nWe continue this until $k$.\n\n$$n \\cdot n \\cdot n \\cdots = n^k$$\n\n#### Without Replacement\n\n$$P^n_k = n(n-1)(n-2) \\cdots 2 \\cdot 1 = n!$$\n\nFor the first spot, there are $n$ possibilities. Then, for the next spot, we do not replace the object, so we lose one possibility; thus we are left with $n-1$ possibilities.\n\nWe continue this until $n - (k - 1)$.\n\n### Combinations\n\n#### Without Repetition\n\nLet's say we want to count the number of combinations with $n$ distinct objects, but we only want to choose $k$ objects.\n\n- $n$ distinct objects\n- Pick only $k$ out of $n$ objects\n- Order doesn't matter\n- $n \\geq k$\n\n$${ n \\choose k } = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n\n# Partitions\n\nLet's say we wanted to split $n$ distinct objects into $r$ groups, and those groups are of size $n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_r$ where $n_1 + n_2 + \\ldots + n_r = n$. \n\nIn other words, $n_1, n_2, \\ldots, n_r$ is just the partition of $n$.\n\nWe use the counting principle and define it as the multinomial coefficient,\n\n$${n \\choose n_1,n_2,\\ldots, n_r} = {n \\choose n_1} {n - n_1 \\choose n_2} {n - n_1 - n_2 \\choose n_3} \\cdots {n - n_1 - \\ldots - n_{r-1} \\choose n_r}$$\n\n$$\\frac{n!}{n_1!(n-n_1)!} \\cdot \\frac{(n-n_1)!}{n_2!(n-n_1-n_2)!} \\cdots \\frac{n-n_1-\\ldots-n_{r-1}!}{n_r!(n-n_1-\\ldots-n_{r-1} - n_r)!}$$\n\nFirst, we choose $n_1$ objects to insert into the first group from the pool of $n$.\n\nNext, from the remaining pool of $n - n_1$, we choose however many objects we want to insert into group $n_2$.\n\nWe repeat this until the group $r$.\n\n# Random Variables\n\nA random variable $X$ is a function that assigns a real number $X(w)$ to each outcome $w \\in \\Omega$.\n\n## Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n\nIf $S_X$ is a discrete set, $X$ is a discrete random variable.\n\nWe can assign a probability to each element $x \\in S_X$, and this assignment is called the probability mass function (PMF). In essence, we are assigning some weight to how probable an element $x$ occurs.\n\nGiven a PMF $\\bold{P}(X = x)$, it has the properties:\n- $\\bold{P}(X = x) \\geq 0$\n- $\\displaystyle \\sum_x \\bold{P}(X = x) = 1$\n\n### Geometric Probability Mass Function / Distribution\n\nThe geometric probability mass function describes the situation in which $k$ independent trials are required before the event occurs with probability $p$.\n\n$$P(K = k) = (1-p)^{k-1}p$$\n$$\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\bold{P}(K=k) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty (1-p)^{k-1} p$$\n\n## Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)\n\nThe cumulative distribution function describes the situation in which the random value $X$ will take a value less than or equal to $x$.\n\n$$F_X(x) = \\bold{P}(X \\leq x)$$\n\n## Probability Generating Function (PGF)\n\nThe probability generating function is a sequence encompasses both the probabilities and possible values associated with a random variable.\n\n$$G_X(z) = \\bold{E}[z^x] = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty z^k \\bold{P} (X=k) = z^0 \\bold{P}(K = 0) + z^1 \\bold{P}(K = 1) + z^2 \\bold{P}(K = 2) + \\dots$$\n\n- Each exponent $k$ of $z^k$ denote the possible values a random variable can take on. \n- The coefficient of $z^k$ denotes the probability attached to the possible value.\n\nIf we take the first derivative:\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{d}G_X}{\\text{d}z} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty k z^{k-1} \\bold{P} (X=k)$$\n\nAnd second derivative:\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{d}^2G_X}{\\text{d}z^2} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty k(k-1) z^{k-2} \\bold{P} (X=k)$$\n\n### Expectation Value\n\nThe expectation value is the average of the probability mass function. In other words, it is the value we expect the most, as this is where the distribution of weights is located in the probability mass function.\n\nIt is the first derivative of the [PGF](#probability-generating-function-pgf) where $z=1$.\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{d}G_X}{\\text{d}z}\\Bigr|_{z=1} = \\bold{E}[X] = \\sum_{k \\in S_x} k \\bold{P} (X = k)$$\n\n### Second Moment\n\nThe second moment is the sum of the first and second derivatives of the [PGF](#probability-generating-function-pgf) where $z=1$.\n\n$$\\frac{\\text{d}^2G_X}{\\text{d}z^2}\\Bigr|_{z=1} + \\frac{\\text{d}G_X}{\\text{d}z}\\Bigr|_{z=1} = \\bold{E}[X^2]$$\n\n### Variance\n\nThe variance tells us how far numbers are spread out from the average or expected value.\n\n$$\\text{Var}[X] = \\bold{E}[X^2] - \\bold{E}[X]^2 = \\frac{\\text{d}^2G_X}{\\text{d}z^2}\\Bigr|_{z=1} + \\frac{\\text{d}G_X}{\\text{d}z}\\Bigr|_{z=1} - \\Big(\\frac{\\text{d}G_X}{\\text{d}z}\\Bigr|_{z=1}\\Big)^2$$\n\n### Standard Deviation\n\nThe standard deviation describes the spread of values.\n\n$\\text{stdiv} = \\sqrt{\\text{var}[X]}$\n"}}]);
