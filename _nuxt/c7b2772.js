Itâ€™s not solely programming algorithms, solving problems, evaluating solutions, testing outcomes or managing teams, but a collection of the above. That is the appeal of software engineering; it promises challenge, uniqueness and diversity.\r\n\r\n## What I love\r\nThe depth of software engineering is seemingly as unfathomably bottomless as the Mariana Trench; you could continue down the abyss and still have more opportunities in the field. Which of the countless areas areas interests me? I am ardent about full stack engineering. In my opinion, fullstack engineering is a gratifying field to work in because it grants me to create two components of the application puzzle, the front and backend. For the frontend piece, I can express my creativity and implement the part that the user interacts with. In addition, I can also have a part in the other essential piece, creating the logic of the application and application programmable interfaces.\r\n\r\n<img class="ui centered medium image w-64" src="../images/clocks.jpg">\r\n\r\n<a style="background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px" href="https://unsplash.com/@jontyson?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z"></path></svg></span><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px">Jon Tyson</span></a>\r\n\r\n## My biggest enemy\r\nAlthough I have experience with software development, there is one part of software engineering that is my biggest enemy: handling time pressure. Watching the clock countdown by the second when timing a workout of the day. Looking at my calendar and counting the days left for a project deadline. Situations like these fabricate thoughts to divert my focus overpower my brain with non-pertinent thoughts. Will I be able to finish on time? How much more time do I have? What if I cannot the problem? These overpowering thoughts are the exact ones I hope to suppress to allow me to gain composure in high-stress situations through practice.\r\n\r\n## Becoming a conqueror\r\nNothing in life comes easy, and software engineering skills are no exception. Mastering it requires years of motivation, experience and practice; I did not become an expert in full stack engineering by being apathetic. Thus far, I have created at least five large scale applications under my belt due to my passion for it. To conquer my biggest enemy, I must apply the same principles. My career depends on it.\r\n'}}]);
