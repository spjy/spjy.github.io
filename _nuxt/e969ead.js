I aim to be perfect, standing out from the rest.\r\n\r\nEach day I must be watched, for a brown leaf will mar my appearance. Each day I must be cut of my unneeded branches, for they merely burden me. Each day I must be watered, to grow and become perfect.\r\n\r\nThe branches were glaring imperfections where I have strayed— but with each leaf, I have covered up each mistake and reverted to the central path: up. I have many branches, here and there, twisting and turning, unable to find the way. But with every millimeter— every centimeter— I toil to shape each branch for the betterment of the trunk.\r\n\r\nEveryday, I keep growing, growing, and growing, but to no avail.  With each branch I must cut— because I am still in the pursuit of perfection.\r\n\r\nBonsai Image by [Kari Shea](https://unsplash.com/@karishea?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge)"}}]);
