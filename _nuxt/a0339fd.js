We can apply dominant pole analysis if certain conditions are met.\n\n### Dominant Pole Analysis\n\nThe idea behind dominant pole analysis is that the further a pole is from the imaginary axis, the faster the pole decays; therefore, it has less of an effect it has on the overall response.\n\nAs a result, we can use the appropriate formulae depending on the number of poles and the precision desired.\n\n#### Zeros Analysis\n\nThe closer the zero is to the dominant poles, the more effect it has on the response.\n\nAs the zero becomes further from the dominant poles, it approaches that of a two pole system.\n\nIf the zero is on the right half plane, the \n\n# Stability\n\nA system is said to be stable if all bounded inputs yield a bounded output.\n\nFor an LTI system, it is stable if the natural response $\\rightarrow$ 0 as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$.\n\nPoles that appear in the left hand (of the $j\\omega$ axis), real plane are considered stable because they converge and decay, whereas those that lie on the right hand, complex plane explode and diverge.\n\nAt least one pole on the right hand plane is enough to throw the system into instability since it diverges.\n\n## Routh-Hurwitz Criterion\n\nGiven a closed loop transfer function:\n\n$$\\frac{N(s)}{a_n s^n + a_{n-1} s^{n-1} + a_{n-2} s^{n-2} + a_{n-3} s^{n-3} + \\dots + a_1 s + a_0}$$\n\nThe corresponding Routh table is:\n\n||||||\n|-|-|-|-|-|\n| $s^{n} \\text{}$ | $a_n$ | $a_{n-2} \\text{}$ | $\\dots$ | $a_1$ | $0$ |\n| $s^{n-1} \\text{}$ | $a_{n-1} \\text{}$ | $a_{n-3} \\text{}$ | $\\dots$ | $a_0$ | $0$ |\n| $s^{n-2} \\text{}$ | $-\\frac{1}{a_{n-1}} \\begin{vmatrix} a_n & a_{n-2} \\\\ a_{n-1} & a_{n-3} \\end{vmatrix} \\text{}$ | $-\\frac{1}{a_{n-1}} \\begin{vmatrix} a_{n-2} & a_{n-4} \\\\ a_{n-3} & a_{n-5} \\end{vmatrix} \\text{}$\n| $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$ | \n| $s^1$ |\n| $s^0$ |\n\nFrom this table, we can deduce that the number of roots of the polynomial that are in the right half plane is equal to the number of sign changes in the first column.\n\nIn other words, the first column must contain all positive values in order for the system to be stable.\n\n## Relative Stability\n\nA transfer function is relatively stable with stability margin if the distance of the poles are at least $\\sigma$ from the imaginary plane.\n\n# Steady State Error\n\nSteady state error is the error left when the steady state dies out.

In other words, it shows the paths of the closed loop poles as the gain varies.\n\nWe can see the various pole locations in the complex plane. Poles on the LHP correspond to exponential decay, while those on the RHP correspond the exponential growth. Additionally, those that have a complex component to it come in pairs. On the imaginary axis, the poles correspond to a higher frequency of the wave. A combination of both the real and imaginary components corresponds to exponential and sinusoidal motion.\n\nTherefore, we can determine values of K such that our system is stable using this analysis tool.\n\nOnly the poles dictate the natural response of the system.\n\n### Properties of Negaitve Feedback System\n\nFor a closed loop transfer function of the form\n\n$$T(s) = \\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)} = \\frac{KG(s)}{1+KG(s)H(s)}$$\n\n#### Pole Locations\n\nThe pole locations are given by setting the characteristic polynomial of the denominator to zero\n\n$$KG(s)H(s) = 0 \\implies KG(s)H(s)=-1=1 \\angle 180 ^{\\circ} (2k+1), k\\in\\mathbb{Z}$$\n\n#### Magnitude Criterion\n\nThe magnitude criterion is given by:\n\n$$|KG(s)H(s)| = 1$$\n\nFor any point $s$ on the root locus, this equality must be satisfied.
