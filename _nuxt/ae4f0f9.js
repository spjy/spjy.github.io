To modernize the functionality and user interface, this application was developed. \n\n\n## My contribution\n\nAngular and Adonis were two new technologies to me, so some portion was dedicated to learning it and also teaching my teammate how to use them.\n\nI worked on everything, including the database structure, API endpoints, and user interface design. I also implemented the designs. However, I focused especially on the UI/UX design of the website.\n\n## Takeaways\n\nI often hear jokes about Angular in the dev community, but I suppose that is due to its predacessor, AngularJS. Working with Angular, I was pleasantly surprised at its ability to enforce important code paradigms, including code organization and separation of concerns. However, a downside is that it was quite verbose- Angular generated four files per component, which made it difficult to navigate the file tree.\n\nIn addition, I honed in on my UI/UX skills and built interfaces that I am proud of, as I have not thought this creatively previously. For example, I\'m quite proud of thinking of the assign office/user mode and also the timeline approval.\n\n<img class="h-36" src="/images/lts-doe-assign.png" />\n<img class="h-36" src="/images/lts-doe-approval.png" />\n\n\n'}}]);
