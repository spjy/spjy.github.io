Repetition is boring. Repetition is boring. Repetition is boring. Well, that type is. User interface (UI) frameworks seem repetitive and generic if you have experienced them after the umpteenth time, exemplified in my case. I have an extensive past with UI frameworks: Bootstrap, Materialize, Semantic UI, Ant Design, Bulma, Vuetify, Skeleton - and there are undoubtedly more - so by merely glancing at a website, I can usually decipher whether it was built with a framework. Although UI frameworks may seem to be cookie-cutter or to indicate monotony, they have provided me with a wealth of knowledge about the world of HTML and CSS.\r\n\r\n## After using a plethora of frameworks\r\n\r\nWith experience applying over seven various UI frameworks over the past few years, I extracted invaluable skills from them, including allowing me to learn modern practices and discover obscure implementations. Furthermore, I have also learned of their design constraints and as a result have compromised and resorted to an alternative tool.\r\n\r\nWhen I was first learning HTML and CSS, I would always see Material themed websites, and I always wished to build one myself. On those websites, I found myself perusing the developer tools to learn how to implement it myself. However, I felt that I encountered a *deja vu* moment- didn\'t I see that CSS class `nav-wrapper` before? I Googled the class, and up popped materializecss.com. I was speechless. I felt like I was in a candy store. Component after component after component I looked, and I thought, this is all for free?\r\n\r\n## The good\r\n\r\nThe first framework I chose and learned was Materialize. It was designed by Google and there were a plethora of components at my disposal. What else could I ask for? Well, I gained knowledge about modern paradigms and practices such as responsive design. From frameworks, I learned about using flexboxes, media queries and the importance of creating a website that speaks universally for all devices, especially in an evermore mobile world. In addition, I learned about CSS frameworks such as SCSS and SASS to accelerate development. More fundamentally, I learned about simpler techniques such as CSS selectors and animations.\r\n\r\n## Compromising between raw CSS and frameworks\r\n\r\nAfter a few years of experience constructing websites, I stumbled upon gold. A new tool that compromises between having the flexibility of raw CSS while also having the rapid development of a full fledged framework. Itâ€™s called Tailwind CSS, a utilitarian, unopinionated CSS framework. It defines commonly used foundational CSS classes, such as flexbox, alignment, typographical, and design classes while also being unobtrusive in design decisions.  Thus far, it has not disappointed in its promise.\r\n\r\n## Getting the most out of UI frameworks\r\n\r\nUI frameworks provided me with a solid set of training wheels for exploring the world of HTML and CSS. For instance, it has allowed me to learn about modern best practices and small tricks for implementing certain designs. Hidden behind the facade of repetitive designs is a wealth of knowledge. The creators behind such UI frameworks are usually professional designers and are experts at frontend design, so who else is better to learn from?\r\n'}}]);
