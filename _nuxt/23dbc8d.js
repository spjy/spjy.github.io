Thus, people in the field who discover novel methods to solve problems in a certain domain document those designs, such as the idea of a model-view-controller (MVC), in the form of a design pattern in hopes that other people may both benefit and critique that model to discover its use cases and advantages, and disadvantages.\r\n\r\n# Design patterns in other areas\r\n\r\nDesign patterns can also be seen with computer assemblies. There are a variety of recurring use cases for computers, such as portable computing, gaming, and high performance computing, and all these require varying component layouts. For example, a browsing computer may not need a graphics card or as much computing, so its form factor can be designed to be compact and minimalistic. On the other hand, a gaming computer may require more performance power, so a larger case may be required to fit larger and more components to serve its purpose. Furthermore, on an even larger scale, in a server environment, high performance computers consume even more resources than a gaming computer and thus require more space, components. Also, to maximize space, they may make the case height short but the area wide to stack them.\r\n\r\n# My experience with software design patterns\r\n\r\nPrior to learning what design patterns were, I have implemented a plethora of them, for example model-view-controller (MVC) when creating web applications with Express and React to easily separate areas of concern and observers when working with socket communication. Additionally, I have dabbled in the PHP framework Laravel where it seems to only use known design patterns, such as factories, abstract factories, builders, singletons, decorators, and facades. These design patterns did their job. For example, at first, I did not know how to structure or implement a web server and interface, so I experimented with combining the server and client into a monorepo and mashing the two concerns together. However, when I discovered MVC, I tried it out and it worked perfectly for my case.\r\n\r\n# The case for using design patterns\r\n\r\nDesign patterns may seem obvious and intuitive (maybe since I am versed in programming languages), but that is the goal- to document patterns that provide success to improve productivity for future implementations and to avoid encountering identical problems. It might also be useful for newcomers. In my opinion, these are all beneficial to draw on inspiration for many problems. Like the cliche phrase says, “don’t reinvent the wheel”, I think it applies perfectly here. If there exists a tried and true design that fits your use case, why not use it? Of course, there will be situations where many will not fit your situation, then you may need to invent your own!\r\n'},530:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: Egregious Ethics\r\nimage: /images/gavel.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-04-23\r\ndescription: Ethics keeps order in the world.

Before we continue, I think it is important to differentiate between having ethics and making mistakes. An engineer could be ethical, but, as all humans are, we all are susceptible to mistakes. Additionally, as an engineer, it is imperative to maintain a moral compass as we have a broad sphere of influence on others’ lives. One of the main ethical issues surrounding software engineering includes the issue of privacy, and the main offenders include primarily advertising conglomerates Amazon and Google.\r\n\r\n# No ethics broken here\r\n\r\nA multitude of people criticize companies such as Facebook or Google for intruding upon our privacy for a misconstrued reason. For example, many criticize Google for tracking their online presence while using their services and demand payment in exchange for it. However, in their terms of use, you agree to be tracked since you are the product. In exchange for that, they provide excellent free services such as Google Drive, Docs and Excel. In my opinion, this behavior violates no ethicals and is a perfectly fair trade.\r\n\r\n# Ethics offenders\r\n\r\nThe situation which violates ethics is when companies intrude upon your information without permission. For example, an instance where Google violated ethics was when they intruded upon unencrypted Wi-Fi networks and collected private information using their StreetView cars driving by homes. These are situations in which ethics are broken, as it is a clear breach of privacy and have no right to obtain that information. Similarly, just because a door is unlocked does not mean you have permission to enter and steal someone’s belongings. As a result of Google’s actions, people may have felt their rights be violated. A data leak or hack from Google could occur where people’s information could be released without the owner of the data knowing.\r\n\r\n# Avoiding breaching ethics\r\n\r\nGoogle violated three ethical Association for Computing Machinery principles, “Be honest and Trustworthy”, “Respect Privacy” and “Honor Confidentiality”. With its response to the StreetView incident, it denied it collected any data, but it backpettled the claim was true; an engineer collaborated with their superior about the feature. Regarding the next two breaches of principles, it breached the privacy of personal Wi-Fi networks by tapping into unencrypted traffic and collecting personal data. It seems like the communication between the engineers diminished, and it also seemed to have avoided an ethics review board. This situation should have never happened, as it is blatantly a violation of people’s privacy. \r\n'},531:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: Introspective Instillation\r\nimage: /images/code.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-05-07\r\ndescription: Software engineering is an extensive field, and I have explored it.\r\ntags: Software Engineering, Reflection\r\ngithub:\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a style="background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px" href="https://unsplash.com/@clemhlrdt?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z"></path></svg></span><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px">Clément H</span></a>\r\n\r\nDespite the implication of the name, software engineering is not just about creating software. Software engineering is about the encompassing process, from start to finish, of how to create the software, including managing projects, setting up development environments, enforcing coding standards, and weighing certain design philosophies. This fact is something that I only recently instilled after introspection. Although I realized that software engineering encompasses more than solving problems through software, I am familiar with all of the concepts presented throughout ICS 314 from my experience personally and professionally.\r\n\r\n# My experience personally\r\n\r\nPersonally, I have dabbled in web development in my spare time, and from it have developed a taste for my own coding development environment using Visual Studio Code, a knowledge of coding standards (enforcing of strict code syntax) using linters, and a familiarity of various methods of implementing and organizing code such as the [model-view-controller model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller). All of these aspects are familiar to me and I feel that I have a comfortable grasp of them.\r\n\r\n# My experience professionally\r\n\r\nProfessionally, I have experience with agile project management and open source software development at the Hawaii Space Flight laboratory. For agile, it is useful to organize tasks into a central platform; it increases organization and productivity. I endured a time without it, and the difference is like night and day. Additionally, I maintain open source software at my job, and it is surprisingly different to develop for compared to private code. I notice that I need to maintain the documentation and test for bugs much more frequently as it is code that many people use. \r\n\r\n# Importance of these software engineering ideas\r\n\r\nIn the end, software engineering includes all aspects that are required to successfully deploy a piece of software, from the type of editor you use, the way you manage the project, the frameworks you use, and the designs you decide to use. As a result, it is imperative to be exposed to all of these facets to become a superb software engineer.\r\n'},532:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: The Joys of a Challenge\r\nimage: /images/diving.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-02-06\r\ndescription: Software engineering is an extensive field, and I hope to explore it.\r\ntags: Software Engineering, Goals\r\ngithub:\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a style="background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px" href="https://unsplash.com/@jwaldrop?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z"></path></svg></span><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px">Jacob Waldrop</span></a>\r\n\r\nSoftware engineering: an art that encompasses the process of creating software. It’s not solely programming algorithms, solving problems, evaluating solutions, testing outcomes or managing teams, but a collection of the above. That is the appeal of software engineering; it promises challenge, uniqueness and diversity.\r\n\r\n## What I love\r\nThe depth of software engineering is seemingly as unfathomably bottomless as the Mariana Trench; you could continue down the abyss and still have more opportunities in the field. Which of the countless areas areas interests me? I am ardent about full stack engineering. In my opinion, fullstack engineering is a gratifying field to work in because it grants me to create two components of the application puzzle, the front and backend. For the frontend piece, I can express my creativity and implement the part that the user interacts with. In addition, I can also have a part in the other essential piece, creating the logic of the application and application programmable interfaces.\r\n\r\n<img class="ui centered medium image w-64" src="../images/clocks.jpg">\r\n\r\n<a style="background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px" href="https://unsplash.com/@jontyson?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z"></path></svg></span><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px">Jon Tyson</span></a>\r\n\r\n## My biggest enemy\r\nAlthough I have experience with software development, there is one part of software engineering that is my biggest enemy: handling time pressure. Watching the clock countdown by the second when timing a workout of the day. Looking at my calendar and counting the days left for a project deadline. Situations like these fabricate thoughts to divert my focus overpower my brain with non-pertinent thoughts. Will I be able to finish on time? How much more time do I have? What if I cannot the problem? These overpowering thoughts are the exact ones I hope to suppress to allow me to gain composure in high-stress situations through practice.\r\n\r\n## Becoming a conqueror\r\nNothing in life comes easy, and software engineering skills are no exception. Mastering it requires years of motivation, experience and practice; I did not become an expert in full stack engineering by being apathetic. Thus far, I have created at least five large scale applications under my belt due to my passion for it. To conquer my biggest enemy, I must apply the same principles. My career depends on it.\r\n'},533:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: Juxtaposing JavaScript\r\nimage: /images/relationships.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-01-23\r\ndescription: JavaScript is good— for the right jobs.\r\ntags: JavaScript\r\ngithub:\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a style="background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px" href="https://unsplash.com/@evertonvila?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z"></path></svg></span><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px">Everton Vila</span></a>\r\n\r\n## My past\r\n\r\nPrior to this class, I have had an intimate relationship with JavaScript. Although this is true, I am not infatuated with it. Exposure to JavaScript began in my senior year of high school in 2017 when the science fair piqued and motivated my interest in coding. Recently, my job as a software developer has involved me writing complex JavaScript code nearly everyday for a web application that visualizes data. Even with this past, I maintain a safe distance from it.\r\n\r\n## Convenience over foundational knowledge\r\n\r\nJavaScript inherently has a multitude of convenience features. Dynamic variable and function types; automatic memory management; an absence of a compilation step. The facade is deceiving; on the surface, it seems like a utopia, almost like JavaScript should be the quintessential, universal language that developers flock to like crows approaching a rotting carcass. After all, to the contrary, low-level languages such as C++ require static variable function types, manual memory management, and compilation of source code.\r\n\r\nSimply put, JavaScript atrocious. Specifically, the promotion of abstracting foundational computer science knowledge is atrocious. Since Python also has a dynamic variable and function type system, I find this anecdote still fitting: I once asked a Python question to a computer science student in a tutorial class: “When an array is passed into a function parameter, is it a reference to or a copy of the array?” In a joking voice, he said, “It’s a reference to it. You computer engineers think too much. It’s Python.” \r\n\r\nWhether that student was joking or not, it is agreeable that, to write effective code, rudimentary knowledge of computer architecture concepts is required. Static variable and function typing promote the fact that types populate specific size of memory space on the memory stack. Memory management practices promote the fact that data is stored at a certain address in memory. Compilation knowledge promotes the fact that machines understand binary, not plaintext. In other words, JavaScript abstraction hides these important computer science concepts in its convenience pocket, and students should exercise their due diligence to learn the foundations and maintain caution to avoid complacency.\r\n\r\n<img class="ui centered medium image w-64" src="../images/reconcile.jpg">\r\n\r\n<a style="background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px" href="https://unsplash.com/@enriq_b312?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z"></path></svg></span><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px">Octavio Fossatti</span></a>\r\n\r\n## Reconciling with JavaScript\r\n\r\nDespite my apparent antipathy towards JavaScript, I think it is, in reality, a useful language to learn. You may be confused- I just ranted about JavaScript’s atrocities. Even though it does promote apathy towards learning computer science fundamentals, I do think it can be a beneficial tool because of its simplicity if used with caution, which I briefly touched on previously. Occasionally, a developer may want to quickly prototype and retrieve the output without having to worry about those fundamental principles. Furthermore, they may want to create an open source project based on a simple and easy to understand language so it is easier to contribute to. In those cases, JavaScript excels and is a good programming language. Another instance is if you are forced to develop for the web- in that case, JavaScript maintains a monopoly on web functionality languages.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, a developer should select the tool that fits the job. In order to get to that stage, extensive practice, akin to athletic practice, is required to have that intuition. Thus, in my opinion, JavaScript is considered good if it accomplishes the job at hand. And, of course, this applies to any language or tool.\r\n'},534:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: Miniscule Magnitude\r\nimage: /images/miniscule.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-09-12\r\ndescription: Actions are bigger than you think.\r\ntags: Creativity\r\ngithub:\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\n<span>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@noemieke?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Noémi Macavei-Katócz</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/miniscule?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></span>\r\n\r\nCan a whistle in Hawaii cause a tornado in Minnesota?\r\n\r\nCan a kick in the Pacific Ocean cause a tsunami in the Arctic?\r\n\r\nCan a stomp in Britain cause an earthquake in Japan?\r\n\r\nCan a spill in Canada cause a hurricane in India?\r\n'},535:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default="---\r\ntitle: Project Plans\r\nimage: /images/broken-toilet.jpeg\r\ndate: 2020-03-31\r\ndescription: A proposal for how I should tackle my final project for ICS 314.\r\ntags: Meteor, Project\r\ngithub:\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Overview\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\nThe majority of University of Hawaii campus is archaic and derelict, presumably from its age and climate. Thus, it is prone to non-functional facilities. Currently, for the main campus, there is no public or convenient place to report broken infrastructure to the proper parties. \r\n\r\n## The Solution\r\n\r\nThe solution to the problem is to create a website that allows people to easily report infrastructure that requires service requests. This will allow issues to not go unnoticed, and therefore will increase the quality of the campus. The authorities can easily organize each report and distribute it to the proper people to resolve the issue accordingly.\r\n\r\n# Mockup Page Ideas\r\n\r\nThe landing page will outline the purpose of the website and how to use it. Then, for the functionality, the students or faculty can do basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations for each of their service requests. To combat invalid requests, we can require that the user needs a hawaii.edu email. Furthermore, the administrator will be able to view all service requests that each person submits on an admin only page. They can share each requests to the appropriate party so they can begin with resolving the issue. The facility staff will have accounts and will be able to see the distributed requests by the administrator; they will also update the status of the issue.\r\n\r\n# Use Cases\r\n\r\n- A student or faculty member sees an issue with, say, a water fountain improperly dispensing water.\r\n- They then submit an issue to the website, outlining basic information like a description of the issue and the location.\r\n- An administrator sees the requests and decides which party needs to be hailed to resolve the issue.\r\n- The party receives the request information and does what they need to do.\r\n- The party then updates the status of their work so the user can see the progress.\r\n\r\n# Beyond the Basics\r\n\r\n- Use phone's GPS to locate exact location of issue.\r\n- Use phone's camera to see exactly what is wrong.\r\n"},536:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default="---\r\ntitle: Pursuit of Perfection\r\nimage: /images/bonsai.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-01-20\r\ndescription: A bonsai tree is the epitome of perfection.\r\ntags: Creative, Metaphorical\r\ngithub:\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\nI am like a bonsai tree, impeccably groomed, meticulously trimmed, and delicately watered.

That is, “everyone” is referring to those that have common sense. If you fail to learn that fact, you will surely learn it in the industry. I wholeheartedly, undoubtedly agree with all of those people. I’m sure you have heard this one before too: if you, as an engineer, are incapable of effectively conveying your ideas verbally and textually, then it is as if the idea was never conceived. \r\n\r\n## Questions from younger me\r\nA subskill within communication includes the ability to ask quality, smart questions. If you’ve ever written code, you know what Stack Overflow is- the congregation of programming related questions. When I posted my first Stack Overflow question, it was not the most flattering; I received a reputation score of “-1”. A wave of emotions hit me. At first, flustered, I saw that my reputation score on the top right went down! Then, puzzled, I brushed it off as a mistake at first. Finally, the wave crashed and, I reflected. I realized it was an atrocious question, which can be seen [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36832933/text-not-going-to-next-line-staying-on-the-same-line-as-previous-text). \r\n\r\nThat first question I asked is embarrassing, but there are lessons to be learned! Specifically, because it was not meticulously thought out such that an answerer could immediately deciphered and solved because I did not include essential details, and I did not put in any effort into learning the HTML fundamentals. But, I do not want to bash and barrade my high school self; I was an HTML and CSS newbie at the time- and of course a smart question questioner newbie. Some things I did right: I outlined the issue I encountered and provided my attempt at the solution, and I even provided a JSFiddle!\r\n\r\n## Exploring questions in the wild\r\nA good question is demonstrated in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59608609/how-can-i-add-a-url-param-after-a-link-is-clicked-in-vue-js). He first outlined what he currently has implemented on his web page in the first paragraph. Thereafter, he provides an example of what the issue is and asks what the outcome should be if the issue were solved. Most importantly, he provides a direct code example of what he tried and what he wishes to adjust. I understood immediately how to solve the issue because of its clarity; thus I stamp my approval of it being a good question!\r\n\r\nTo the contrary, an example of a bad question is summed up in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59598571/press-power-button-trigger-a-function-in-react-native). The person asked a Googleable question and demonstrates no effort at all. Research into the React Native application programmable interface would have been an easy solution,  or simple search for a similar tutorial on how to achieve this is at his fingertips. It seems like he is asking this question for an assignment. I'm sure no (normal) person wants to create an entire project for him. The fact that no answers or comments have been posted and it has been greater than a week reinforces the fact that it is a bad question.\r\n\r\n## Why bother with smart questions?\r\nA quality, smart question, in my opinion, can be evaluated by one feature: it can be easily answered by a fellow developer. It is imperative for software engineers to ask smart questions in order to effectively progress self-knowledge. For example, when learning a new concept, being able to materialize a smart question will lead to smart answers. If an engineer cannot effectively communicate that question, then it will result in time wasted and people irked. Additionally, picking the minds of smarter people in the field will result in a knowledge dump, and as a result a profound enlightenment could occur. Ultimately, they are experts in the field, and they have encountered a multitude of scenarios and issues and can speak about them.\r\n\r\nIn a professional setting, asking smart questions are important too. Say that you are assigned a task to complete a website with vague requirements. Asking smart questions would flesh out any details now, and it may even present new ideas to the assignee. If you were hesitant to ask questions for clarification from arrogance or timidness, wasted time can result. That is, wasted time, for example, spent to create something that your boss did not even want.\r\n\r\n## It’s smart to ask smart questions!\r\nIn the end, software engineers should practice asking smart questions. Smart questions result in a plethora of benefits, including saved time, less frustration, new ideas, and more. Next to no detrimental effects can result from asking a smart question.\r\n"},538:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: Reasonable Repetition\r\nimage: /images/cookie-cutter.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-02-27\r\ndescription: Repetition is boring.

Repetition is boring. Repetition is boring. Repetition is boring. Well, that type is. User interface (UI) frameworks seem repetitive and generic if you have experienced them after the umpteenth time, exemplified in my case. I have an extensive past with UI frameworks: Bootstrap, Materialize, Semantic UI, Ant Design, Bulma, Vuetify, Skeleton - and there are undoubtedly more - so by merely glancing at a website, I can usually decipher whether it was built with a framework. Although UI frameworks may seem to be cookie-cutter or to indicate monotony, they have provided me with a wealth of knowledge about the world of HTML and CSS.\r\n\r\n## After using a plethora of frameworks\r\n\r\nWith experience applying over seven various UI frameworks over the past few years, I extracted invaluable skills from them, including allowing me to learn modern practices and discover obscure implementations. Furthermore, I have also learned of their design constraints and as a result have compromised and resorted to an alternative tool.\r\n\r\nWhen I was first learning HTML and CSS, I would always see Material themed websites, and I always wished to build one myself. On those websites, I found myself perusing the developer tools to learn how to implement it myself. However, I felt that I encountered a *deja vu* moment- didn\'t I see that CSS class `nav-wrapper` before? I Googled the class, and up popped materializecss.com. I was speechless. I felt like I was in a candy store. Component after component after component I looked, and I thought, this is all for free?\r\n\r\n## The good\r\n\r\nThe first framework I chose and learned was Materialize. It was designed by Google and there were a plethora of components at my disposal. What else could I ask for? Well, I gained knowledge about modern paradigms and practices such as responsive design. From frameworks, I learned about using flexboxes, media queries and the importance of creating a website that speaks universally for all devices, especially in an evermore mobile world. In addition, I learned about CSS frameworks such as SCSS and SASS to accelerate development. More fundamentally, I learned about simpler techniques such as CSS selectors and animations.\r\n\r\n## Compromising between raw CSS and frameworks\r\n\r\nAfter a few years of experience constructing websites, I stumbled upon gold. A new tool that compromises between having the flexibility of raw CSS while also having the rapid development of a full fledged framework. It’s called Tailwind CSS, a utilitarian, unopinionated CSS framework. It defines commonly used foundational CSS classes, such as flexbox, alignment, typographical, and design classes while also being unobtrusive in design decisions.  Thus far, it has not disappointed in its promise.\r\n\r\n## Getting the most out of UI frameworks\r\n\r\nUI frameworks provided me with a solid set of training wheels for exploring the world of HTML and CSS. For instance, it has allowed me to learn about modern best practices and small tricks for implementing certain designs. Hidden behind the facade of repetitive designs is a wealth of knowledge. The creators behind such UI frameworks are usually professional designers and are experts at frontend design, so who else is better to learn from?\r\n'},539:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: Upholding Uniformity\r\nimage: /images/patterns.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-02-13\r\ndescription: Even though cumbersome, coding standards are for the best.\r\ntags: Coding Standards, Uniformity, Linters\r\ngithub:\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\n<a style="background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px" href="https://unsplash.com/@carlevarino?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;utm_content=creditBadge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" style="height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-2px;fill:white" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M10 9V0h12v9H10zm12 5h10v18H0V14h10v9h12v-9z"></path></svg></span><span style="display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px">Cesar Carlevarino Aragon</span></a>\r\n\r\nIt’s dangerous succumbing to the norm. Have your own thoughts. Have your own opinions. Have your own ideas. Have your own methodologies. Submitting to the pressure to follow the rest is difficult to digest, but ultimately habituating this practice is in your best interest. Otherwise, you may be ousted and become an outcast. But that is only if you fail to follow a coding standard. It’s like night and day—between having code uniformity and not. I have endured both ends of the spectrum.\r\n\r\n## From no standards at all...\r\nAt work, each developer is responsible for determining their own code style. A true nightmare it was. For example, when I was initially hired, I was assigned to maintain web application project where another developer accomplished a substantial amount of work, but it was to the point of being unmaintainable. There was no file structure; the file names were ambiguous and contained a nebulous cluster of unrelated functions. Furthermore, the code was unreadable because of inconsistent formatting; it was as if they used a randomizer to determine what format they were to use next. The spacing was inconsistent, the variable purpose was undescriptive and comments were lacking. I even provided an ESLint configuration in the project, but they neglected to use it!! Here’s an example of what the code looked like:\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction get_live_data(data, key){\r\n\r\n\r\n\tvar stream_data = [  ];\r\n\tfor (var i =0; i < data.length; i++) {\r\n\t\t      var k= data[i]\r\n\r\n\t\t\r\nvar v=stream_data;\r\n\tvar j = ‘’;\r\n}\r\n\t// … rest of code\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have also experienced the polar opposite—absolutely no coding standards. To the contrary, one project I am a developer for imposes rigid coding standards down to the tab spacing. It was like heaven compared to what I had to endure at work. For the backend programming, they even used Golang, a language that imposes a linter into its compiler. On the other hand, for the frontend, they used ESLint. Traversing and understanding the code logic took significantly less time to decipher compared to not having any coding standards.\r\n\r\n## Reflecting on the journey through coding standards\r\nWith the numerous benefits of coding standards also comes with a few gripes. Sometimes, it can become a chore to resolve all the issues in the short term; however, I fully understand the benefit in the long term. For example, sometimes I want to comment out a variable to debug, but the linter configuration I use halts compilation unless all coding rules are satisfied. Thus, I have to also adjust another part in the code to conform to the rule when I just wanted to change one line, for example, since I have the “no unused variable” rule enabled. For example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst example = (param1, param2) => {\r\n\t// const ex = param1 + 1;\r\n//  => if I comment this out, I also have to comment out param1 since \r\n// since I have no-unused-vars rule on\r\n\treturn param2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Coding standards are lit\r\nI have firsthand experience of both having coding standards— and not having them at all. From that experience, I can confidently say, it is imperative to uphold uniformity when coding, especially in a team setting. Maintainability increases. Productivity improves. Debugging becomes easier. Syntax errors are reduced. These are as a result of having one less layer of processing required when viewing code, and your brain can focus on more important matters such as understanding the logic behind the code.\r\n'},540:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: Aerolly Aeroponics\r\nimage: /images/aeroponics.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-03-01\r\ndescription: A system that facilitates accelerated plant growth through IoT.\r\ntags: Python, Raspberry Pi, Vue, Linux, EE\r\ngithub: https://github.com/aerolly\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nConventional farming requires a preponderance of time, resources, and experience. For example, a farmer must have large parcels of land, heavy machinery, and years of knowledge to maintain the farm. To the contrary, aeroponics, a system that directly mists roots of the plants with nutrient water, has the ability to scale vertically, allowing for larger yields and more localized farms. Additionally, integrating technology into it will allow automation through the internet of things and reduce the barrier to entry of farming knowledge through machine learning. Therefore, investigating and exploiting these advantages and integrating it into a reproducible, scalable system is the goal of this project.\r\n\r\n## The Start\r\n\r\nIn March 2020, myself and two other friends began to plan out the system through creating block, electrical, and mechanical diagrams, a parts list, mechanical models, and proposals.\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n\r\n### Hardware\r\n\r\nWe decided to use a wood frame to suspend halves of a gallon barrel. Then, using a U-bracket frame, we were to suspend a plastic sheet with holes large enough for 1" net cups over the open half of the barrel.\r\n\r\n### Water System\r\n\r\nIt begins with the reservoir, a 5 gallon homer bucket. Then, a 100 PSI diaphragm pump drives the water into a 5 gallon pressurized accumulator tank. Solenoid values then control the flow to the misters in the grow bed.\r\n\r\n### Electrical System\r\n\r\nIt begins with a 12V 30A direct current power supply, providing to two solenoid valves, a pump, and a pressure sensor. A Raspberry Pi is the hub for the pressure sensor, temperature sensor, and a relay (SSR). The relay controls the two solenoid valves and pump to control it on and off. \r\n\r\n### Software System\r\n\r\n<img class="h-36" src="/images/aerolly-dashboard.png">\r\n\r\nA Python program on the Raspberry Pi collects data and sends it to an API gateway to save it to a database and broadcast it to the frontend. In addition, another Python program handles incoming control requests to control the relay and collect sensor data.\r\n\r\nA server hosts the API gateway, database, and user interface.\r\n\r\nThe API gateway is based on Flask, a web framework in Python; it allows for easy creation of a RESTful and WebSocket API. Secondly, the database consists of a persistent and volatile storage. The persistent storage uses PostgreSQL to store data in the long term; however, the volatile storage uses Redis for real-time communication and caching. Finally, the user interface uses Vue.js, allowing users to easily control components on and off, as well as view live data.\r\n\r\n### Machine Learning\r\n\r\nTo optimize the growth of the plants, we will collect data related to power consumption, water consumption, spray length, spray duration, light intensity, temperature, and humidity and compare it against the plant height to learn what the best conditions are to grow the said plants.\r\n\r\n## Takeaways\r\n\r\nTechnically, from this project, I boosted my knowledge of electronics and software. On the electronics side, I learned how to wire up a real world circuit as well as how to solder wires together. For the software side, I furthered my knowledge of networking, server creation, server management, the Raspberry Pi, and system connection. In the future, I hope to improve the system by implementing the [machine learning](#machine-learning) aspect of it to further automate the system. \r\n'},541:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: COSMOS Web\r\nimage: /images/cosmos.png\r\ndate: 2020-01-03\r\ndescription: A web application that allows control of satellites and visualization of data.\r\ntags: JavaScript, C, C++, Linux\r\ngithub: https://github.com/spjy/cosmos-web\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\nCOSMOS Web, based on React, was conceived to replace the archaic and rigid desktop applications used to plan and manage satellite mission operations. To the contrary, web applications are evaluated to be more modern and flexible to allow for rapid development and quick configuration. It was built with a focus on customizability of pages, layouts, components and settings to cover a variety of situations to function specifically with [COSMOS](http://cosmos-project.org), a framework that unifies diverse architectures through connectivity. For example, parts of COSMOS Web can be built for a radio and displaying its temperature data, downlink rate, or uplink rate, and it can be displayed in plaintext or a chart. This is from its ability to be flexible.\r\n\r\nFor this project, I planned, pioneered and conceived the foundations of COSMOS Web by offering my expertise and fervor for web development. Initially, it began as a prototype to test the limitations and capabilities of web development; connectivity between COSMOS and the web was juxtaposed against the desktop applications to evaluate the benefits. Then, once it was determined that it was a viable solution, planning commenced, visions were shared such as essential features and various implementations. This included ideologies such as having customizable pages dedicated for missions, satellites and ground stations. Within those pages, common, shared components would be created, including charts, real time data display, orbit visualization and command control. I executed these visions for the web portion.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this project involved frontend and backend development. The frontend consists of JavaScript, specifically the React framework. I used the Neutrino tool, React Hooks and ESLint. It uses TailwindCSS and Ant Design as the user interface (UI) framework. On the other hand, for the backend, since COSMOS uses C++, I opted to use C++ to conveniently interface with it. It communicates with COSMOS using the user datagram protocol (UDP). Not only that, but it also is the medium that connects COSMOS with COSMOS Web; it accomplishes this through websockets.\r\n\r\n<img class="h-36" src="/images/cosmos-web.png">\r\n\r\nFrom this experience building COSMOS Web, I learned essential communication skills. Communication wise, I learned the importance of not being timid of asking questions, even if I thought it was trivial. For example, if I had a design or technical question, hesitating would decrease productivity. Asking a simple two minute question would have saved two hours of struggle.\r\n'},542:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default="---\r\ntitle: Jotted\r\nimage: /images/jotted.png\r\ndate: 2019-08-01\r\ndescription: An engine to prettify Markdown.

This means the tool had to have Markdown as its base and be able to render LaTeX math equations. Additionally, another feature it had to have was customizable theming; I am particular about the appearance. I had researched the internet for a tool that fulfilled all of the above requirements, yet none fit the bill. Thus, I challenged myself to build it myself.\r\n\r\nI opted to use Nuxt since it had single page application (SPA) capabilities, it supports Vue.js and it is simple to bootstrap. Single page applications are excellent for this case since they are compatible with free static site publishers such as GitHub pages. Thus, it will cost little to nothing to host. In my opinion, Vue.js is a superior frontend framework because of its simplicity, low learning curve and natural syntax. With React, it invented a completely new dialect that mashed together HTML, CSS and JavaScript called JSX; however, with Vue.js, it maintains HTML, CSS and JavaScript and has separations of concerns for each language. Finally, Nuxt is easy to bootstrap. It has a simple command line interface tool that asks for what frameworks and tools you would like to use in the project, for example which ESLint configuration, unit tester or frontend framework you would like to use. Thereafter, it generates the file structure.\r\n\r\nThe functionality is simple. I first set up a Markdown renderer, namely Markdown It for its impeccable plugin community. I set it up as a Nuxt plugin and installed the LaTeX renderer, code highlighter, table of contents and anchor renderers and frontmatter reader, and I configured it to render each markdown file on a certain route.\r\nIn order to use it, the user simply has to connect the git repository to the Jotted engine and submodule it in the specified directory. They can write any valid Markdown! In addition, to render the LaTeX, they simply have to wrap it in double dollar sign tags (ex. `$$x = 1$$`).\r\n \r\nThrough this project, I advanced my design skills in CSS and technical skills in Vue. I designed the markdown rendered pages, including the header, card, link and table styling. From this, I learned design principles such as how to space data and represent typography. In addition to design skills, I gained technical skills in using the Nuxt, the Vue.js framework. I learned how to parse Markdown into a fully styled HTML page.\r\n"},543:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: Legislative Tracking System\r\nimage: /images/lts-doe.jpg\r\ndate: 2020-09-01\r\ndescription: State legislative bill tracker and testimony manager.\r\ntags: TypeScript, Angular 14, AdonisJS\r\ngithub: https://github.com/HACC2022/Monsoon-Rain\r\nlink: https://devpost.com/software/monsoon-rain\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Purpose\r\n\r\nIn its current state, the Hawaii Department of Education\'s (HIDOE) legislative tracking system is on Lotus Notes and will be decomissioned in the near future.

I also implemented the designs. However, I focused especially on the UI/UX design of the website.\r\n\r\n## Takeaways\r\n\r\nI often hear jokes about Angular in the dev community, but I suppose that is due to its predacessor, AngularJS. Working with Angular, I was pleasantly surprised at its ability to enforce important code paradigms, including code organization and separation of concerns. However, a downside is that it was quite verbose- Angular generated four files per component, which made it difficult to navigate the file tree.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I honed in on my UI/UX skills and built interfaces that I am proud of, as I have not thought this creatively previously. For example, I\'m quite proud of thinking of the assign office/user mode and also the timeline approval.\r\n\r\n<img class="h-36" src="/images/lts-doe-assign.png" />\r\n<img class="h-36" src="/images/lts-doe-approval.png" />\r\n\r\n\r\n'},544:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n.r(t),t.default='---\r\ntitle: ohia.ai\r\nimage: /images/ohia.jpg\r\ndate: 2018-09-01\r\ndescription: An open Hawaiian indigenous plant identification and aggregation application.\r\ntags: Vue, Quasar\r\ngithub: https://github.com/HACC2018/ohia.ai\r\nlink:\r\n---\r\n\r\nohia.ai is an application that identifies primarily Hawaiian plants and aggregates them through crowd-sourced data. It was conceived from the 2018 Hawaii Annual Code Challenge. We placed fourth.\r\n\r\nTechnologically, it consists of a Vue.js frontend, Node.js server and TensorFlow for machine learning. Due to the short deadlines of the challenge, we used the [Quasar framework](https://quasar.dev/) for [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for rapid development. It provides pre-built material design user interface components and quality of life Vue.js features. For example, it allows for a simple conversion into a mobile application from a web application. Furthermore, we used the Node.js server as a middleware, gluing together the database, frontend and the plant identification. Finally, we used [TensorFlow Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras), specifically the [MobileNet V1 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04861), to handle the plant identification on phones. \r\n\r\n<img class="h-36" src="/images/ohia-app.jpg" />\r\n\r\nI met this group through a friend, and we meshed together well.

Our main goal was to create a mobile application with it in order to exploit the camera of smartphones. \r\n\r\nFrom this project, I learned of techniques on how to collaborate with a team. Since I essentially knew nobody, I needed to forge friendships with them in order to have a successful project. We used Slack, zoom and in-person meetings to facilitate discussions to create a successful project. Additionally, we also used the GitHub project management tools such as the kanban board and issues to remain organized and on task.

A user can browse available restaurants and order food from the yUHmmy application.\r\n\r\n## My contributions\r\n\r\nI mainly worked on the design and frontend features of the web application. I created mockups with design and experience in mind. However, it was quite challenging having to build around Semantic UI since we could not get custom styling working; thus, some aspects were mismatching such as the forms. I also worked on the restaurant list, ordering and restaurant recommendation pages.\r\n\r\n## Takeaways\r\n\r\nThis project proved to be challenging mentally. People were not familiar with standard notations and thus formatting was varied across the board. That is, formatting for aspects that ESLint does not handle. For example, the convention is to use upper camel case for classes and lower camel case for everything else, and people followed their own style. Also, some people were new with GitHub, and at times merge conflicts were improperly handled. \r\n\r\nIn the end, from the project I realized my weakness is patience when working with others. I often assume that others have the same understanding of the topic that I do, and I sometimes become impatient if they do not know how to apply something or make a simple mistake. However, I have to remember that I was there once, and that everybody has their own paces and priorities. It is my job to bring them up to speed if I want to succeed.\r\n\r\n'},552:function(e,t,n){var
