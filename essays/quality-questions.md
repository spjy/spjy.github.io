“Communication is the most important skill to learn as an engineer,” said every professor, counselor, speaker and everyone. That is, “everyone” is referring to those that have common sense. If you fail to learn that fact, you will surely learn it in the industry. I wholeheartedly, undoubtedly agree with all of those people. I’m sure you have heard this one before too: if you, as an engineer, are incapable of effectively conveying your ideas verbally and textually, then it is as if the idea was never conceived. 

## Questions from younger me
A subskill within communication includes the ability to ask quality, smart questions. If you’ve ever written code, you know what Stack Overflow is- the congregation of programming related questions. When I posted my first Stack Overflow question, it was not the most flattering; I received a reputation score of “-1”. A wave of emotions hit me. At first, flustered, I saw that my reputation score on the top right went down! Then, puzzled, I brushed it off as a mistake at first. Finally, the wave crashed and, I reflected. I realized it was an atrocious question, which can be seen [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36832933/text-not-going-to-next-line-staying-on-the-same-line-as-previous-text). 

That first question I asked is embarrassing, but there are lessons to be learned! Specifically, because it was not meticulously thought out such that an answerer could immediately deciphered and solved because I did not include essential details, and I did not put in any effort into learning the HTML fundamentals. But, I do not want to bash and barrade my high school self; I was an HTML and CSS newbie at the time- and of course a smart question questioner newbie. Some things I did right: I outlined the issue I encountered and provided my attempt at the solution, and I even provided a JSFiddle!

## Exploring questions in the wild
A good question is demonstrated in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59608609/how-can-i-add-a-url-param-after-a-link-is-clicked-in-vue-js). He first outlined what he currently has implemented on his web page in the first paragraph. Thereafter, he provides an example of what the issue is and asks what the outcome should be if the issue were solved. Most importantly, he provides a direct code example of what he tried and what he wishes to adjust. I understood immediately how to solve the issue because of its clarity; thus I stamp my approval of it being a good question!

To the contrary, an example of a bad question is summed up in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59598571/press-power-button-trigger-a-function-in-react-native). The person asked a Googleable question and demonstrates no effort at all. Research into the React Native application programmable interface would have been an easy solution,  or simple search for a similar tutorial on how to achieve this is at his fingertips. It seems like he is asking this question for an assignment. I'm sure no (normal) person wants to create an entire project for him. The fact that no answers or comments have been posted and it has been greater than a week reinforces the fact that it is a bad question.

## Why bother with smart questions?
A quality, smart question, in my opinion, can be evaluated by one feature: it can be easily answered by a fellow developer. It is imperative for software engineers to ask smart questions in order to effectively progress self-knowledge. For example, when learning a new concept, being able to materialize a smart question will lead to smart answers. If an engineer cannot effectively communicate that question, then it will result in time wasted and people irked. Additionally, picking the minds of smarter people in the field will result in a knowledge dump, and as a result a profound enlightenment could occur. Ultimately, they are experts in the field, and they have encountered a multitude of scenarios and issues and can speak about them.

In a professional setting, asking smart questions are important too. Say that you are assigned a task to complete a website with vague requirements. Asking smart questions would flesh out any details now, and it may even present new ideas to the assignee. If you were hesitant to ask questions for clarification from arrogance or timidness, wasted time can result. That is, wasted time, for example, spent to create something that your boss did not even want.

## It’s smart to ask smart questions!
In the end, software engineers should practice asking smart questions. Smart questions result in a plethora of benefits, including saved time, less frustration, new ideas, and more. Next to no detrimental effects can result from asking a smart question.
