# Overview

## The Problem

The majority of University of Hawaii campus is archaic and derelict, presumably from its age and climate. Thus, it is prone to non-functional facilities. Currently, for the main campus, there is no public or convenient place to report broken infrastructure to the proper parties. 

## The Solution

The solution to the problem is to create a website that allows people to easily report infrastructure that requires service requests. This will allow issues to not go unnoticed, and therefore will increase the quality of the campus. The authorities can easily organize each report and distribute it to the proper people to resolve the issue accordingly.

# Mockup Page Ideas

The landing page will outline the purpose of the website and how to use it. Then, for the functionality, the students or faculty can do basic create, read, update and delete (CRUD) operations for each of their service requests. To combat invalid requests, we can require that the user needs a hawaii.edu email. Furthermore, the administrator will be able to view all service requests that each person submits on an admin only page. They can share each requests to the appropriate party so they can begin with resolving the issue. The facility staff will have accounts and will be able to see the distributed requests by the administrator; they will also update the status of the issue.

# Use Cases

- A student or faculty member sees an issue with, say, a water fountain improperly dispensing water.
- They then submit an issue to the website, outlining basic information like a description of the issue and the location.
- An administrator sees the requests and decides which party needs to be hailed to resolve the issue.
- The party receives the request information and does what they need to do.
- The party then updates the status of their work so the user can see the progress.

# Beyond the Basics

- Use phone's GPS to locate exact location of issue.
- Use phone's camera to see exactly what is wrong.
